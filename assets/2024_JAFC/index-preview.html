<meta name="citation_abstract" content="Lignins are a key adaptation enabling vascular plants to thrive in terrestrial habitats. Lignin is heterogeneous – containing upwards of 30 different monomers – and its function multifarious: It provides structural support, predetermined breaking points, UV-protection, diffusion barriers, pathogen resistance and drought resilience. Recent studies, carefully characterising lignin *in situ,* have started to identify specific lignin compositions and ultrastructures with distinct cellular functions, but our understanding remains fractional. We summarise recent works and highlight where further *in situ* lignin analysis could provide valuable insights into plant growth and adaptation. We also summarise strengths and weaknesses of lignin *in situ* analysis methods.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Principal component analysis;,citation_abstract=Principal component analysis (pca) is a multivariate technique that analyzes a data table in which observations are described by several inter-correlated quantitative dependent variables. Its goal is to extract the important information from the table, to represent it as a set of new orthogonal variables called principal components, and to display the pattern of similarity of the observations and of the variables as points in maps. The quality of the pca model can be evaluated using cross-validation techniques such as the bootstrap and the jackknife. Pca can be generalized as correspondence analysis (ca) in order to handle qualitative variables and as multiple factor analysis (mfa) in order to handle heterogenous sets of variables. Mathematically, pca depends upon the eigen-decomposition of positive semi-definite matrices and upon the singular value decomposition (svd) of rectangular matrices.;,citation_author=Hervé Abdi;,citation_author=Lynne J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=An ABA-GA bistable switch can account for natural variation in the variability of arabidopsis seed germination time;,citation_abstract=Genetically identical plants growing in the same conditions can display heterogeneous phenotypes. Here we use Arabidopsis seed germination time as a model system to examine phenotypic variability and its underlying mechanisms. We show extensive variation in seed germination time variability between Arabidopsis accessions and use a multiparent recombinant inbred population to identify two genetic loci involved in this trait. Both loci include genes implicated in modulating abscisic acid (ABA) sensitivity. Mutually antagonistic regulation between ABA, which represses germination, and gibberellic acid (GA), which promotes germination, underlies the decision to germinate and can act as a bistable switch. A simple stochastic model of the ABA-GA network shows that modulating ABA sensitivity can generate the range of germination time distributions we observe experimentally. We validate the model by testing its predictions on the effects of exogenous hormone addition. Our work provides a foundation for understanding the mechanism and functional role of phenotypic variability in germination time.;,citation_author=Katie Abley;,citation_author=Pau Formosa-Jordan;,citation_author=Hugo Tavares;,citation_author=Emily YT Chan;,citation_author=Mana Afsharinafar;,citation_author=Ottoline Leyser;,citation_author=James CW Locke;,citation_editor=Daniel J Kliebenstein;,citation_editor=Jürgen Kleine-Vehn;,citation_publication_date=2021-06;,citation_cover_date=2021-06;,citation_year=2021;,citation_doi=10.7554/eLife.59485;,citation_issn=2050-084X;,citation_volume=10;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=eLife;,citation_publisher=eLife Sciences Publications, Ltd;">

To determine whether isoforms of l-Phe ammonia-lyase (PAL), the first enzyme in the pathway, can associate with the next enzyme, the endomembrane-bound cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H), to facilitate channeling, we generated transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants independently expressing epitope-tagged versions of two PAL isoforms (PAL1 and PAL2) and C4H. Subcellular fractionation and protein gel blot analysis using epitope- and PAL isoform-specific antibodies indicated both microsomal and cytosolic locations of PAL1 but only cytosolic localization of PAL2. However, both PAL isoforms were microsomally localized in plants overexpressing C4H. These results, which suggest that C4H itself may organize the complex for membrane association of PAL, were confirmed using PAL-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusions with localization by confocal microscopy. Coexpression of unlabeled PAL1 with PAL2-GFP resulted in a shift of fluorescence localization from endomembranes to cytosol in C4H overexpressing plants, whereas coexpression of unlabeled PAL2 with PAL1-GFP did not affect PAL1-GFP localization, indicating that PAL1 has a higher affinity for its membrane localization site than does PAL2. Dual-labeling immunofluorescence and fluorescence energy resonance transfer (FRET) studies confirmed colocalization of PAL and C4H. However, FRET analysis with acceptor photobleaching suggested that the colocalization was not tight.;,citation_author=Lahoucine Achnine;,citation_author=Elison B.

Post-synthesis lignin integration into the plant cell wall is unclear, including how the hydrophobic lignin incorporates into the wall in an initially hydrophilic milieu. Self-assembly, self-organization and aggregation give rise to a complex, 3D network of lignin that displays randomly branched topology and fractal properties. Attempts at isolating lignin, analogous to archaeology, are instantly destructive and non-representative of in planta. Lack of plant ligninases or enzymes that hydrolyze specific bonds in lignin-carbohydrate complexes (LCCs) also frustrate a better grasp of lignin. Supramolecular self-assembly, nano-mechanical properties of lignin-lignin, lignin-polysaccharide interactions and association-dissociation kinetics affect biomass deconstruction and thereby cost-effective biofuels production.;,citation_author=Komandoor Elayavalli Achyuthan;,citation_author=Ann Mary Achyuthan;,citation_author=Paul David Adams;,citation_author=Shawn Matthew Dirk;,citation_author=Jason Carl Harper;,citation_author=Blake Alexander Simmons;,citation_author=Anup Kumar Singh;,citation_publication_date=2010;,citation_cover_date=2010;,citation_year=2010;,citation_issue=12;,citation_doi=10.3390/molecules15118641;,citation_isbn=1420-3049 (Electronic){\textbackslash}r1420-3049 (Linking);,citation_issn=14203049;,citation_pmid=21116223;,citation_volume=15;,citation_journal_title=Molecules;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Recent advances in the study of Clp, FtsH and other proteases located in chloroplasts;,citation_abstract=Several chloroplast proteases have been characterized in recent years. The ATP-dependent chloroplast proteases Clp and FtsH stand out because they form multi-subunit complexes consisting of different gene products. Surprisingly, both green and non-green plastids appear to contain a similar soluble Clp core proteolytic complex, consisting of five ClpP proteases, their non-catalytic ClpR homologs, and two ClpS homologs that have unknown function. Analyses of single and double FtsH1, FtsH2, FtsH5 and FtsH8 mutants, and overexpression of FtsH proteins in these Arabidopsis thaliana mutants show partial redundancies within pairs of closely related FtsH thylakoid proteins. The presence of at least one member of each pair is essential for functional accumulation. Other chloroplast proteases have also been identified recently. Future challenges include the identification of substrate recognition mechanisms and elucidating the role of proteases in chloroplast biogenesis and function. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Emerging roles for diverse intramembrane proteases in plant biology;,citation_abstract=Progress in the field of regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) in recent years has made its impact on plant biology as well. Although this field within plant research is still in its infancy, some interesting observations have started to emerge. Gene encoding orthologs of rhomboid proteases, site-2 proteases (S2P), presenilin/??-secretases, and signal peptide peptidases are found in plant genomes and some of these gene products were identified in different plant cell membranes. The lack of chloroplast-located rhomboid proteases was associated with reduced fertility and aberrations in flower morphology. Mutations in homologues of S2P resulted in chlorophyll deficiency and impaired chloroplast development. An S2P was also implicated in the response to ER stress through cleavage of ER-membrane bZIP transcription factors, allowing their migration to the nucleus and activation of the transcription of BiP chaperones. Other membrane-bound transcription factors of the NAC and PHD families were also demonstrated to undergo RIP and relocalization to the nucleus. These and other new data are expected to shed more light on the roles of intramembrane proteases in plant biology in the future.

Laccase production requires a cost effective boost from host organisms to meet the needs for its numerous applications. Addition of 1.2ï\frac{1}{2}gï\frac{1}{2}L -1 lignin to media culture of Trametes versicolor improved laccase production up to 1213.93ï\frac{1}{2}Uï\frac{1}{2}L -1 , which was 3.69-fold higher in comparison with that without lignin addition. The laccase production of 1009.49ï\frac{1}{2}Uï\frac{1}{2}L -1 was achieved using the lignin-contained hydrolysate from steam-exploded corn stalk in practice. Elucidated mechanism of lignin-stimulated laccase production showed increased production of reactive oxygen species and the copy number of the laccase gene transcript in the treated mycelia. Together these results provide insight into some of the intrinsic metabolic processes involved in the up-regulation of laccase production in the presence of lignin.

B.S.P.;,citation_abstract=Native-state organization and distribution of cell-wall components in the secondary wall of woody tissue from P. mariana (Black Spruce) have been investigated using polarized Raman microspectroscopy. Evidence for orientation is detected through Raman intensity variations resulting from rotations of the exciting electric vector with respect to cell-wall geometry. Spectral features associated with cellulose and lignin were studied. The changes in cellulose bands indicate that the pyranose rings of the anhydroglucose repeat units are in planes perpendicular to the cross section, while methine C-H bonds are in planes parallel to the cross section. Changes in bands associated with lignin indicate that the aromatic rings of the phenyl-propane units are most often in the plane of the cell-wall surface. However, regions where lignin orientation departs from this pattern also occur. These results represent direct evidence of molecular organization with respect to cellular morphological features in woody tissue, and indicate that cell-wall components are more highly organized than had been recognized. Studies carried out in order to establish the usefulness and sensitivity of the Raman technique to differences of composition within the cell walls provide evidence of variations in the distribution of cellulose and lignin.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=FT-Raman spectroscopy for direct measurement of lignin concentrations in kraft pulps;,citation_abstract=This study used near-infrared (IR) Fourier transform (FT) Raman spectroscopy was used to quantify residual lignin in unbleached and partially bleached pine kraft pulps. The pulps used in this study were bleached using CEDED and polyoxometalate (POM) bleaching sequences. The intensity of lignin’s 1600 cm-1 Raman band, which represents one of the phenyl ring vibrations, was used as a measure of the total amount of lignin in pulp samples. When the 1600 cm-1 band intensities were compared with pulp kappa numbers, the band intensities were found to be linearly related to the kappa numbers. This linear relationship holds for both CEDED- and POM-bleached pulps, indicating that the 1600 cm-1 band intensity is mostly independent of bleaching chemistry and is dependent upon the number of phenyl groups in pulps. Consequently, FT-Raman spectroscopy has the potential for determining lignin concentrations in unbleached and partially bleached kraft pulps. The Raman technique is attractive because it is rapid, is not labor intensive, and does not result in the destruction of pulp samples.;,citation_author=Umesh P Agarwal;,citation_author=Ira A Weinstock;,citation_author=Rajai H Atalla;,citation_publication_date=2003;,citation_cover_date=2003;,citation_year=2003;,citation_issue=1;,citation_volume=2;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Tappi J.;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Raman imaging to investigate ultrastructure and composition of plant cell walls: Distribution of lignin and cellulose in black spruce wood (Picea mariana);,citation_abstract=A detailed understanding of the structural organization of the cell wall of vascular plants is important from both the perspectives of plant biology and chemistry and of commercial utilization. A stateof-the-art 633-nm laser-based confocal Raman micro scope was used to determine the distribution of cell wall components in the cross section of black spruce wood in situ. Chemical information from morphologi cally distinct cell wall regions was obtained and Raman images of lignin and cellulose spatial distribution were generated. While cell corner (CC) lignin concentration was the highest on average, lignin concentration in compound middle lamella (CmL) was not significantly different from that in secondary wall (S2 and S2–S3). Images generated using the 1,650 cm–1 band showed that coniferaldehyde and coniferyl alcohol distribution followed that of lignin and no particular cell wall layer/ region was therefore enriched in the ethylenic residue. In contrast, cellulose distribution showed the opposite pattern—low concentration in CC and CmL and high in S2 regions. Nevertheless, cellulose concentration varied significantly in some areas, and concentrations of both lignin and cellulose were high in other areas.;,citation_author=Umesh P.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Determination of ethylenic residues in wood and TMP of spruce by FT-Raman spectroscopy;,citation_abstract=A method based on FT-Raman spectroscopy is proposed for determining in situ concentrations of ethylenic residues in softwood lignin. Raman contributions at 1133 and 1654 cm-1, representing coniferaldehyde and coniferyl alcohol structures, respectively, were used in quantifying these units in spruce wood with subsequent conversion to concentrations in lignin. For coniferaldehyde units, the intensity of the 1133 cm-1 peak was measured in the difference spectrum obtained by subtracting the bleached-wood spectrum from that of the unbleached. In the case of coniferyl alcohol residues, the intensity of the 1654 cm-1 band was calculated from the spectrum of extensively bleached wood. The concentrations of coniferaldehyde and coniferyl alcohol units in spruce lignin were found to be 3.8% and 3.4%, respectively, and were in good agreement with values determined by conventional techniques. This quantification of the ethylenic residues was based on the Raman intensities of 1% coniferaldehyde and 1% coniferyl alcohol in bleached softwood kraft pulp. Initially, as background for this work, a number of suitable lignin model compounds and a softwood lignin model polymer (G-DHP) were used to calibrate the Raman method and demonstrate that the Raman technique was well suited for quantification of ethylenic structures. Experimental results demonstrated that thermomechanical pulping reduced the concentrations of coniferaldehyde and coniferyl alcohol residues in comparison to wood by 28% and 24%, respectively.;,citation_author=Umesh P.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Near-IR surface-enhanced Raman spectrum of lignin;,citation_abstract=Compacted powders of commercially available nano- and microparticles of silver were used to successfully induce the surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) effect in spruce milled-wood lignin (MWL). For the two silver particle sizes used in this investigation, the spectra were mostly similar. Some general characteristics of the lignin SERS spectrum are described. The SERS technique was found to be sensitive for detecting lignin. Significant spectral changes were present between the SERS and normal Raman spectra of MWL. The SERS spectrum was assigned on the basis of literature-reported vibrational assignments of lignin and its models. Based on significant changes in Raman features, we propose that the lignin is strongly adsorbed on silver. To determine whether SERS of lignin can be obtained directly from wood without its isolation, Wiley-milled spruce wood (WMW) adsorbed on silver was studied. The results indicated that not only the surface-enhancement effect was successfully induced in the WMW, but that its spectrum was similar to MWL SERS. Moreover, for WMW, no signals from the carbohydrate components were observed, and therefore, lignin was detected selectively. This nano- and microparticle-based molecularly specific method is expected to make a significant contribution in identifying and investigating lignin in various lignin-containing materials.

In the simple method, crystallinity in cellulose I samples was determined based on univariate regression that was first developed using the Raman band intensity ratio of the 380 and 1,096 cm-1 bands. For calibration purposes, 80.5% crystalline and 120-min milled (0% crystalline) Whatman CC31 and six cellulose mixtures produced with crystallinities in the range 10.9–64% were used. When intensity ratios were plotted against crystallinities of the calibration set samples, the plot showed a linear correlation (coefficient of determination R 2 = 0.992). Average standard error calculated from replicate Raman acquisitions indicated that the cellulose Raman crystallinity model was reliable. Crystallinities of the cellulose mixtures samples were also calculated from X-ray diffractograms using the amorphous contribution subtraction (Segal) method and it was found that the Raman model was better. Additionally, using both Raman and X-ray techniques, sample crystallinities were determined from partially crystalline cellulose samples that were generated by grinding Whatman CC31 in a vibratory mill. The two techniques showed significant differences. In the second approach, successful Raman PLS regression models for crystallinity, covering the 0–80.5% range, were generated from the ten calibration set Raman spectra. Both univariate-Raman and WAXS determined crystallinities were used as references. The calibration models had strong relationships between determined and predicted crystallinity values (R 2 = 0.998 and 0.984, for univariate-Raman and WAXS referenced models, respectively). Compared to WAXS, univariate-Raman referenced model was found to be better (root mean square error of calibration (RMSEC) and root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) values of 6.1 and 7.9% vs. 1.8 and 3.3%, respectively). It was concluded that either of the two Raman methods could be used for cellulose I crystallinity determination in cellulose samples.;,citation_author=Umesh P. Agarwal;,citation_author=Richard S.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=FT-Raman Investigation of Milled-Wood Lignins: Softwood, Hardwood, and Chemically Modified Black Spruce Lignins;,citation_abstract=Raman spectroscopy is being increasingly applied to study wood and other lignin-containing biomass/biomaterials. Lignin’s contribution to the Raman spectra of such materials needs to be understood in the context of various lignin structures, substructures, and functional groups so that lignin-specific features could be identified and the spectral information could be interpreted usefully. Additionally, to enhance the utility of Raman as a characterization tool, an understanding of chemical-treatment-induced changes to the lignin spectrum is important. In the present work, Raman spectra of four milled-wood lignins (MWLs)—black spruce, loblolly pine, aspen, and sweetgum—were compared, and using black spruce MWL, spectral changes brought about by alkaline hydrogen peroxide bleaching, hydrogenation, acetylation, and methylation reactions were analyzed.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Strigolactone signaling is required for auxin-dependent stimulation of secondary growth in plants;,citation_abstract=Long distance cell-to-cell communication is critical for the development of multicellular organisms. In this respect, plants are especially demanding as they constantly integrate environmental inputs to adjust growth processes to different conditions. One example is thickening of shoots and roots, also designated as secondary growth. Secondary growth is mediated by the vascular cambium, a stem cell-like tissue whose cell-proliferating activity is regulated over a long distance by the plant hormone auxin. How auxin signaling is integrated at the level of cambium cells and how cambium activity is coordinated with other growth processes are largely unknown. Here, we provide physiological, genetic, and pharmacological evidence that strigolactones (SLs), a group of plant hormones recently described to be involved in the repression of shoot branching, positively regulate cambial activity and that this function is conserved among species. We show that SL signaling in the vascular cambium itself is sufficient for cambium stimulation and that it interacts strongly with the auxin signaling pathway. Our results provide a model of how auxin-based long-distance signaling is translated into cambium activity and suggest that SLs act as general modulators of plant growth forms linking the control of shoot branching with the thickening of stems and roots.;,citation_author=Javier Agusti;,citation_author=Silvia Herold;,citation_author=Martina Schwarz;,citation_author=Pablo Sanchez;,citation_author=Karin Ljung;,citation_author=Elizabeth A.

The inhibition analysis with Lineweaver-Burk plots clearly showed that the type of inhibition is non-competitive. The enzymatic oxidation of veratryl alcohol in the presence of 14C-oxalic acid yielded radioactive carbon dioxide. The results indicate that the apparent inhibition of LiP is caused by reduction of the veratryl alcohol cation radical intermediate back to the substrate level by oxalate, which is concomitantly oxidized to carbon dioxide.;,citation_author=Y Akamatsu;,citation_author=D B Ma;,citation_author=T Higuchi;,citation_author=M Shimada;,citation_publication_date=1990;,citation_cover_date=1990;,citation_year=1990;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2387411;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=0014-5793(90)81169-O [pii];,citation_isbn=0014-5793 (Print){\textbackslash}r0014-5793 (Linking);,citation_issn=0014-5793;,citation_pmid=2387411;,citation_volume=269;,citation_journal_title=FEBS Lett.;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Involvement of VNS NAC-domain transcription factors in tracheid formation in Pinus taeda;,citation_abstract=Vascular plants have two types of water-conducting cells, xylem vessel cells (in angiosperms) and tracheid cells (in ferns and gymnosperms). These cells are commonly characterized by secondary cell wall (SCW) formation and programmed cell death (PCD), which increase the efficiency of water conduction. The differentiation of xylem vessel cells is regulated by a set of NAC (NAM, ATAF1/2 and CUC2) transcription factors, called the VASCULAR-RELATED NAC-DOMAIN (VND) family, in Arabidopsis thaliana Linne. The VNDs regulate the transcriptional induction of genes required for SCW formation and PCD. However, information on the transcriptional regulation of tracheid cell differentiation is still limited. Here, we performed functional analysis of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda Linne) VND homologs (PtaVNS, for VND, NST/SND, SMB-related protein). We identified five PtaVNS genes in the loblolly pine genome, and four of these PtaVNS genes were highly expressed in tissues with tracheid cells, such as shoot apices and developing xylem. Transient overexpression of PtaVNS genes induced xylem vessel cell-like patterning of SCW deposition in tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana Domin) leaves, and up-regulated the promoter activities of loblolly pine genes homologous to SCW-related MYB transcription factor genes and cellulose synthase genes, as well as to cysteine protease genes for PCD. Collectively, our data indicated that PtaVNS proteins possess transcriptional activity to induce the molecular programs required for tracheid formation, i.e., SCW formation and PCD. Moreover, these findings suggest that the VNS–MYB-based transcriptional network regulating water-conducting cell differentiation in angiosperm and moss plants is conserved in gymnosperms.;,citation_author=Nobuhiro Akiyoshi;,citation_author=Yoshimi Nakano;,citation_author=Ryosuke Sano;,citation_author=Yusuke Kunigita;,citation_author=Misato Ohtani;,citation_author=Taku Demura;,citation_publication_date=2020-05;,citation_cover_date=2020-05;,citation_year=2020;,citation_issue=6;,citation_doi=10.1093/treephys/tpz106;,citation_issn=1758-4469;,citation_volume=40;,citation_journal_title=Tree Physiol.;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Reaction conditions for laccase catalyzed polymerization of catechol;,citation_abstract=Poly(catechol) was synthesized in batch runs with laccase from Trametes versicolor (ATCC 200801). The polymerization reaction was conducted in a closed, temperature controlled system containing acetone and sodium acetate buffer for pH control. The effects of the solvent mixture, monomer (catechol), enzyme, medium pH and temperature on the polymerization rate were investigated with respect to initial reaction conditions and depletion rate of dissolved oxygen in the medium. Maximum initial reaction rate was attained with 10% (v/v) acetone-sodium acetate buffer at pH 5.0, 25^\circC, 0.02 U/ml enzyme and 250 mg/l initial catechol and 10 mg/l dissolved oxygen. A general saturation enzyme kinetics response was observed for catechol substrate. Temperature rise supported the rate increase up to 45^\circC, after which the rate tended to be stable due to a drop in dissolved oxygen concentration as well as enzyme instability. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=AtABCG29 is a Monolignol Transporter Involved in Lignin Biosynthesis;,citation_abstract=Lignin is the defining constituent of wood and the second most abundant natural polymer on earth. Lignin is produced by the oxidative coupling of three monolignols: p-coumaryl alcohol, coniferyl alcohol, and sinapyl alcohol [1]. Monolignols are synthesized via the phenylpropanoid pathway and eventually polymerized in the cell wall by peroxidases and laccases. However, the mechanism whereby monolignols are transported from the cytosol to the cell wall has remained elusive. Here we report the discovery that AtABCG29, an ATP-binding cassette transporter, acts as a p-coumaryl alcohol transporter. Expression of AtABCG29 promoter-driven reporter genes and a Citrine-AtABCG29 fusion construct revealed that AtABCG29 is targeted to the plasma membrane of the root endodermis and vascular tissue. Moreover, yeasts expressing AtABCG29 exhibited an increased tolerance to p-coumaryl alcohol by excreting this monolignol. Vesicles isolated from yeasts expressing AtABCG29 exhibited a p-coumaryl alcohol transport activity. Loss-of-function Arabidopsis mutants contained less lignin subunits and were more sensitive to p-coumaryl alcohol. Changes in secondary metabolite profiles in abcg29 underline the importance of regulating p-coumaryl alcohol levels in the cytosol. This is the first identification of a monolignol transporter, closing a crucial gap in our understanding of lignin biosynthesis, which could open new directions for lignin engineering. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.;,citation_author=Santiago Alejandro;,citation_author=Yuree Lee;,citation_author=Takayuki Tohge;,citation_author=Damien Sudre;,citation_author=Sonia Osorio;,citation_author=Jiyoung Park;,citation_author=Lucien Bovet;,citation_author=Youngsook Lee;,citation_author=Niko Geldner;,citation_author=Alisdair R.

We demonstrate that the symptoms of ARWV infections arise from reduced lignification within the secondary cell wall of xylem fibers and result in increased wood digestibility. In contrast, the mid-lamellae region and xylem ray cells are largely unaffected by the infection. Gene expression and proteomic data from symptomatic xylem clearly show the downregulation of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), the enzyme catalyzing the first committed step in the phenylpropanoid pathway leading to lignin biosynthesis. A large increase in soluble phenolics in symptomatic xylem, including the lignin precursor phenylalanine, is also consistent with PAL downregulation. ARWV infection results in the accumulation of many host-derived virus-activated small interfering RNAs (vasiRNAs). PAL-derived vasiRNAs are among the most abundant vasiRNAs in symptomatic xylem and are likely the cause of reduced PAL activity. Apparently, the mechanism used by the virus to alter lignin exhibits similarities to the RNAi strategy used to alter lignin in genetically modified trees to generate comparable improvements in wood properties.6, 7, 8;,citation_author=Holly Allen;,citation_author=Leo Zeef;,citation_author=Kris Morreel;,citation_author=Geert Goeminne;,citation_author=Manoj Kumar;,citation_author=Leonardo D.

Disruption of the genes encoding both cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenases (CADs), including CADC and CADD, in Arabidopsis thaliana results in the atypical incorporation of hydroxycinnamaldehydes into lignin. Another strategy to change lignin composition is downregulation or overexpression of ferulate 5-hydroxylase (F5H), which results in lignins enriched in guaiacyl or syringyl units, respectively. Here, we combined these approaches to generate plants enriched in coniferaldehyde-derived lignin units or lignins derived primarily from sinapaldehyde. The cadc cadd and ferulic acid hydroxylase1 (fah1) cadc cadd plants are similar in growth to wild-type plants even though their lignin compositions are drastically altered. In contrast, disruption of CAD in the F5H-overexpressing background results in dwarfism. The dwarfed phenotype observed in these plants does not appear to be related to collapsed xylem, a hallmark of many other lignin-deficient dwarf mutants. cadc cadd, fah1 cadc cadd, and cadd F5H-overexpressing plants have increased enzyme-catalyzed cell wall digestibility. Given that these CAD-deficient plants have similar total lignin contents and only differ in the amounts of hydroxycinnamaldehyde monomer incorporation, these results suggest that hydroxycinnamaldehyde content is a more important determinant of digestibility than lignin content.;,citation_author=Nickolas A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Loss of FERULATE 5-HYDROXYLASE Leads to Mediator-Dependent Inhibition of Soluble Phenylpropanoid Biosynthesis in Arabidopsis;,citation_abstract=Phenylpropanoids are phenylalanine-derived specialized metabolites and include important structural components of plant cell walls, such as lignin and hydroxycinnamic acids, as well as ultraviolet and visible light-absorbing pigments, such as hydroxycinnamate esters (HCEs) and anthocyanins. Previous work has revealed a remarkable degree of plasticity in HCE biosynthesis, such that most Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mutants with blockages in the pathway simply redirect carbon flux to atypical HCEs. In contrast, the ferulic acid hydroxylase1 (fah1) mutant accumulates greatly reduced levels of HCEs, suggesting that phenylpropanoid biosynthesis may be repressed in response to the loss of FERULATE 5-HYDROXYLASE (F5H) activity. Here, we show that in fah1 mutant plants, the activity of HCE biosynthetic enzymes is not limiting for HCE accumulation, nor is phenylpropanoid flux diverted to the synthesis of cell wall components or flavonol glycosides. We further show that anthocyanin accumulation is also repressed in fah1 mutants and that this repression is specific to tissues in which F5H is normally expressed. Finally, we show that repression of both HCE and anthocyanin biosynthesis in fah1 mutants is dependent on the MED5a/5b subunits of the transcriptional coregulatory complex Mediator, which are similarly required for the repression of lignin biosynthesis and the stunted growth of the phenylpropanoid pathway mutant reduced epidermal fluorescence8. Taken together, these observations show that the synthesis of HCEs and anthocyanins is actively repressed in a MEDIATOR-dependent manner in Arabidopsis fah1 mutants and support an emerging model in which MED5a/5b act as central players in the homeostatic repression of phenylpropanoid metabolism.;,citation_author=Nickolas A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Reductive Catalytic Fractionation of Corn Stover Lignin;,citation_abstract=Reductive catalytic fractionation (RCF) has emerged as an effective biomass pretreatment strategy to depolymerize lignin into tractable fragments in high yields. We investigate the RCF of corn stover, a highly abundant herbaceous feedstock, using carbon-supported Ru and Ni catalysts at 200 and 250 ^\circC in methanol and, in the presence or absence of an acid cocatalyst (H 3 PO 4 or an acidified carbon support). Three key performance variables were studied: (1) the effectiveness of lignin extraction as measured by the yield of lignin oil, (2) the yield of monomers in the lignin oil, and (3) the carbohydrate retention in the residual solids after RCF. The monomers included methyl coumarate/ferulate, propyl guaiacol/syringol, and ethyl guaiacol/syringol. The Ru and Ni catalysts performed similarly in terms of product distribution and monomer yields. The monomer yields increased monotonically as a function of time for both temperatures. At 6 h, monomer yields of 27.2 and 28.3% were obtained at 250 and 200 ^\circC, respectively, with Ni/C. The addition of an acid cocatalysts to the Ni/C system increased monomer yields to 32% for acidified carbon and 38% for phosphoric acid at 200 ^\circC. The monomer product distribution was dominated by methyl coumarate regardless of the use of the acid cocatalysts. The use of phosphoric acid at 200 ^\circC or the high temperature condition without acid resulted in complete lignin extraction and partial sugar solubilization (up to 50%) thereby generating lignin oil yields that exceeded the theoretical limit. In contrast, using either Ni/C or Ni on acidified carbon at 200 ^\circC resulted in moderate lignin oil yields of ca. 55%, with sugar retention values &amp;amp;amp;gt;90%. Notably, these sugars were amenable to enzymatic digestion, reaching conversions &amp;gt;90% at 96 h. Characterization studies on the lignin oils using two-dimensional heteronuclear single quantum coherence nuclear magnetic resonance and gel permeation chromatrography revealed that soluble oligomers are formed via solvolysis, followed by further fragmentation on the catalyst surface via hydrogenolysis. Overall, the results show that clear trade-offs exist between the levels of lignin extraction, monomer yields, and carbohydrate retention in the residual solids for different RCF conditions of corn stover.;,citation_author=Eric M.

Mechanical testing reveals a significantly higher ultimate tensile strength of the interlocked walnut cell tissue compared to the sclerenchyma tissue of a pine seed coat lacking the lobed cell structure. The higher strength value of the walnut shell is explained by the observation that the crack cannot simply detach intact cells but has to cut through the lobes due to the interlocking.

Glucosylation creates water-soluble and chemically stable monolignols by protecting the phenolic hydroxyl group. To discuss the role of sinapyl alcohol glucoside, syringin, in planta, the cellular distribution of syringin in the transverse and radial surfaces of quick-frozen stems of Syringa vulgaris L. (lilac) was visualized by cryo-time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry and scanning electron microscopy (cryo-TOF-SIMS/SEM) analyses. The amount and rough distribution of syringin were confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography measurements using serial tangential sections of freeze-fixed lilac stems. The syringin distribution was also discussed with reference to the tissue classification from microscopic observations. Syringin was mainly found in the phloem region. In the xylem region, syringin was evenly distributed irrespective of the cell type from the cambial zone to the early differentiating stage region and selectively distributed in vessels in the later differentiating stage region. After the lignification of wood fibers, syringin was found in rays and some vessels in the initial part of the annual rings. Previously, artificially administered isotope-labeled syringin was shown to be assimilated into lignin in the differentiating xylem region. Based on this, our present data showing syringin storage in the differentiating xylem region and its variation depending on the lignification stage suggest that syringin works as a lignin precursor.

Two kinds of phenoloxidases, laccase and tyrosinase, have been proposed to participate in tanning, but proof of the true identity of the enzyme(s) responsible for this process has been elusive. We report the cloning of cDNAs for laccases and tyrosinases from the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, as well as their developmental patterns of expression. To test for the involvement of these types of enzymes in cuticle tanning, we performed RNA interference experiments to decrease the levels of individual phenoloxidases. Normal phenotypes were obtained after dsRNA-mediated transcript depletion for all phenoloxidases tested, with the exception of laccase 2. Insects injected with dsRNA for the laccase 2 gene failed to tan, were soft-bodied and deformed, and subsequently died in a dsRNA dose-dependent fashion. The results presented here support the hypothesis that two isoforms of laccase 2 generated by alternative splicing catalyze larval, pupal, and adult cuticle tanning in Tribolium.;,citation_author=Y.

However, despite the impact of lignin on the economic uses of Eucalyptus wood, little is known regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying lignin deposition in this genus. Here, we report on the identification of a laccase gene potentially involved in lignin polymerization in Eucalyptus globulus by employing a combination of phylogenetic analysis, tissue-specific expression analysis, and genetic complementation assays. EglLAC48 is phylogenetically close to the lignin-related gene AtLAC15 of Arabidopsis thaliana and showed increased expression upon in vitro lignification-promoting conditions. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that the expression of EglLAC48 is higher in stems when compared with leaves and roots. In addition, in situ hybridization experiments revealed that EglLAC48 mRNA was mainly localized in developing xylem cells, an important lignification site. In order to provide genetic evidence to support a role for EglLAC48 in lignification, this gene was expressed in the Arabidopsis lac17 mutant background using both the endogenous AtLAC17 promoter and the constitutive CaMV35S promoter. Both strategies were successful in restoring lignin content, but the levels of guaiacyl units were still significantly reduced when compared with those of wild-type plants. The fact that the expression of EglLAC48 was able to restore the lignin levels but not lignin composition of the lac17 mutant suggests that this laccase is potentially involved in lignin polymerization in E. globulus but show different enzyme specificity when compared with AtLAC17.;,citation_author=Pedro Araújo;,citation_author=Felipe Thadeu Tolentino;,citation_author=Igor Cesarino;,citation_author=Rafael Henrique Gallinari;,citation_author=Ward Steenackers;,citation_author=Juliana Lischka Sampaio Mayer;,citation_author=Paulo Mazzafera;,citation_publication_date=2019-12;,citation_cover_date=2019-12;,citation_year=2019;,citation_issue=5;,citation_doi=10.1007/s11105-019-01177-y;,citation_issn=1572-9818;,citation_volume=37;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Plant Mol.

However, the browning that is produced during harvest and the postharvest processes alters the organoleptic and nutritional properties of this fruit, which has made its management as a fresh fruit difficult. The browning processes are regulated by the enzyme family of the polyphenol oxidases (PPOs) located in the thylakoids of the chloroplast. When there is damage at the tissue level, the phenolic compounds found in the vacuoles enter into contact with the polyphenol oxidase. This enzyme produces polymerization among the phenolic compounds, as well as between them and the proteins and cell walls. This study analyzed the polyphenol oxidase in lulo var. Castilla at the genetic level, based on DNA and RNA samples. The results showed a high level of homology with other polyphenol oxidases from plants. The highest degree of homology was found with Solanum melongena L., which belongs to the same clade, Leptostemonum. The tyrosinase and two copper-binding domains, characteristic of the polyphenol oxidase, the conserved residues that maintain the natural environment, the sequence of a signal peptide for targeting chloroplast, and the UTRA domain of transcription regulation for recognizing small molecules were identified.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Ligninolytic fungal laccases and their biotechnological applications;,citation_abstract=Lignin is amorphous in nature, lacks stereoregularity, and is not susceptible to hydrolytic attack. Despite its resistant nature, it is however degraded by various microorganisms, particularly, white-rot fungi. Such fungi are capable of extracellular production of lignin peroxidase, manganese peroxidase, and laccase, the three major enzymes associated with ligninolysis. Though all white-rot fungi do not produce all the three enzymes, laccase occupies an important place in ligninolysis. Laccase belongs to a diverse group of enzymes called oxidoreductases and is also known as benzenediol: oxygen oxidoreductase. They have low substrate specificity. The copper-containing enzyme laccase has been detected in a variety of organisms such as bacteria, fungi, plants, and insects. Mostly, these are extracellular proteins, although intracellular laccases have also been detected in some fungi and insects. Fungal laccases are believed to play a variety of roles, such as, morphogenesis, pathogenesis, and lignin degradation. As an oxidase, laccase is used in many agricultural, industrial, and medicinal applications. Current investigations are focused on laccase-based biooxidation, biotransformation, biosensor, and enzymatic synthesis of organic compounds. By enhancing laccase production using different physiochemical parameters, better understanding of the mechanism for the reactions of interest, and optimizing the catalytic activity of laccase, it can be used in a better way in diverse fields of biotechnology.;,citation_author=Daljit Singh Arora;,citation_author=Rakesh Kumar Sharma;,citation_publication_date=2010;,citation_cover_date=2010;,citation_year=2010;,citation_issue=6;,citation_doi=10.1007/s12010-009-8676-y;,citation_isbn=1559-0291 (Electronic);,citation_issn=02732289;,citation_pmid=19513857;,citation_volume=160;,citation_journal_title=Appl.

We conducted comparative analyses of the biophysical and ecophysiological properties of the two distinct diaspores (mucilaginous seed (M+) vs indehiscent (IND) fruit) in the dimorphic annual Aethionema arabicum (Brassicaceae), linking fruit biomechanics, dispersal aerodynamics, pericarp-imposed dormancy, diaspore abscisic acid (ABA) concentration, and phenotypic plasticity of dimorphic diaspore production to its natural habitat and climate. Two very contrasting dispersal mechanisms of the A. arabicum dimorphic diaspores were revealed. Dehiscence of large fruits leads to the release of M+ seed diaspores, which adhere to substrata via seed coat mucilage, thereby preventing dispersal (antitelechory). IND fruit diaspores (containing nonmucilaginous seeds) disperse by wind or water currents, promoting dispersal (telechory) over a longer range. The pericarp properties confer enhanced dispersal ability and degree of dormancy on the IND fruit morph to support telechory, while the M+ seed morph supports antitelechory. Combined with the phenotypic plasticity to produce more IND fruit diaspores in colder temperatures, this constitutes a bet-hedging survival strategy to magnify the prevalence in response to selection pressures acting over hilly terrain.;,citation_author=Waheed Arshad;,citation_author=Katja Sperber;,citation_author=Tina Steinbrecher;,citation_author=Bethany Nichols;,citation_author=Vincent A.

However, knowledge of the genetic regulation of wood formation is limited. We developed a genome-wide high-throughput system for the discovery and validation of specific transcription factor (TF)-directed hierarchical gene regulatory networks (hGRNs) in wood formation. This system depends on a new robust procedure for isolation and transfection of Populus trichocarpa stem differentiating xylem protoplasts. We overexpressed Secondary Wall-Associated NAC Domain 1s (Ptr-SND1-B1), a TF gene affecting wood formation, in these protoplasts and identified differentially expressed genes by RNA sequencing. Direct Ptr-SND1-B1-DNA interactions were then inferred by integration of time-course RNA sequencing data and top-down Graphical Gaussian Modeling-based algorithms. These Ptr-SND1-B1-DNA interactions were verified to function in differentiating xylem by anti-PtrSND1-B1 antibody-based chromatin immunoprecipitation (97% accuracy) and in stable transgenic P. trichocarpa (90% accuracy). In this way, we established a Ptr-SND1-B1-directed quantitative hGRN involving 76 direct targets, including eight TF and 61 enzyme-coding genes previously unidentified as targets. The network can be extended to the third layer from the second-layer TFs by computation or by overexpression of a second-layer TF to identify a new group of direct targets (third layer). This approach would allow the sequential establishment, one two-layered hGRN at a time, of all layers involved in a more comprehensive hGRN. Our approach may be particularly useful to study hGRNs in complex processes in plant species resistant to stable genetic transformation and where mutants are unavailable.;,citation_author=Y.-C.

The purification included differential sonication of thylakoid membranes, differential (NH4)2SO4 fractionation, gel filtration chromatography and finally either hydrophobic interaction chromatography or anion exchange chromatography. A total purification of more than 5000-fold compared to the original thylakoids enabled the identification of a 43 kDa protein as the VDE, in contrast to earlier reported molecular weight of 54-60 kDa. A detailed comparison was made for the VDE activity and polypeptide pattern for the different fractions throughout the purification and the best correlation was always found for the 43 kDa protein. The highest specific activity obtained was 256 \mumol g-1 s-1 protein, which is at least 10- fold higher than reported earlier. We estimate that there is 1 VDE molecule per 20-100 electron transport chains. The 43 kDa protein was N-terminally sequenced, after protection of cysteine residues with \beta-mercaptoethanol and iodoacetamid, and a unique sequence of 20 amino acids was obtained.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Elucidating the Mechanisms of Assembly and Subunit Interaction of the Cellulose Synthase Complex of Arabidopsis Secondary Cell Walls *;,citation_abstract=&amp;amp;amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cellulose is the most abundant biopolymer in nature; however, questions relating to the biochemistry of its synthesis including the structure of the cellulose synthase complex (CSC) can only be answered by the purification of a fully functional complex. Despite its importance, this goal remains elusive. The work described here utilizes epitope tagging of cellulose synthase A (CESA) proteins that are known components of the CSC. To avoid problems associated with preferential purification of CESA monomers, we developed a strategy based on dual epitope tagging of the CESA7 protein to select for CESA multimers. With this approach, we used a two-step purification that preferentially selected for larger CESA oligomers. These preparations consisted solely of the three known secondary cell wall CESA proteins CESA4, CESA7, and CESA8. No additional CESA isoforms or other proteins were identified. The data are consistent with a model in which CESA protein homodimerization occurs prior to formation of larger CESA oligomers. This suggests that the three different CESA proteins undergo dimerization independently, but the presence of all three subunits is required for higher order oligomerization. Analysis of purified CESA complex and crude extracts suggests that disulfide bonds and noncovalent interactions contribute to the stability of the CESA subunit interactions.

The successful production of polyclonal antibodies against secoisolariciresinol was assessed with indirect enzyme immunosorbent assay (ELISA) by comparison with pre-immune serum and by competitive assays using dilutions of secoisolariciresinol standards.

They were thus used to immunolocalize lignans in flaxseed (Linum usitatissimum), one of the richest sources of lignans.

If any of these assumptions are violated, potentially large errors can be introduced into calculations of dissolved CO2 in xylem and resulting estimates of internal carbon transport. We tested the validity of assumptions related to pHX in Populus deltoides L. with a series of non-manipulative experiments. The pHX derived from stems and twigs was generally similar and remained relatively constant through a diel period.

Similarly, cloudy conditions immediately before an afternoon thunderstorm increased pHX derived from twigs.

In 76% of the genes, signal peptides were predicted, indicating that these bacterial laccases may be exported from the cytoplasm, which contrasts with the current belief. Moreover, several examples of putatively horizontally transferred bacterial laccase genes were described. Many metagenomic sequences encoding fragments of laccase-like enzymes could not be phylogenetically assigned, indicating considerable novelty.

These data demonstrate that two paralogous Arabidopsis thaliana proteases, XYLEM CYSTEINE PROTEASE1 (XCP1) and XCP2, participated in micro-autolysis within the intact central vacuole before mega-autolysis was initiated by tonoplast implosion. The data acquisition was aided by the predictable pattern of seedling root xylogenesis, the availability of single and double total knock-out T-DNA lines, anti-sera that recognized XCP1 and XCP2, and the microwave-assisted processing of whole seedlings prior to immunolabeling and observation in the transmission electron microscope. During secondary wall thickening, XCP1 and XCP2 (in wild type), XCP1 (in xcp2 seedlings) or XCP2 (in xcp1 seedlings) were imported into the TE central vacuole. Both XCP1 and XCP2 heavily labeled dense aggregates of material within the vacuole. However, because of XCP1 deficiency in xcp1 and xcp1 xcp2 TEs, non-degraded cellular remnants first accumulated in the vacuole and then persisted in the TE lumen (longer than in the wild type) after the final mega-autolysis was otherwise complete. This delayed TE clearing phenotype in xcp1 was rescued by complementation with wild-type XCP1. Although TEs in the xcp2 single knock-out cleared comparably with wild type, the non-degraded remnants in xcp1 xcp2 TEs were more densely packed than in xcp1 TEs. Therefore, XCP2 has a minor but distinct role in micro-autolysis.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Autophagy, plant senescence, and nutrient recycling;,citation_abstract=Large numbers of publications have appeared over the last few years, dealing with the molecular details of the regulation and process of the autophagy machinery in animals, plants, and unicellular eukaryotic organisms. This strong interest is caused by the fact that the autophagic process is involved in the adaptation of organisms to their environment and to stressful conditions, thereby contributing to cell and organism survival and longevity. In plants, as in other eukaryotes, autophagy is associated with longevity as mutants display early and strong leaf senescence symptoms, however, the exact role of autophagy as a pro-survival or pro-death process is unclear. Recently, evidence that autophagy participates in nitrogen remobilization has been provided, but the duality of the role of autophagy in leaf longevity and/or nutrient recycling through cell component catabolism remains. This review aims to give an overview of leaf senescence-associated processes from the physiological point of view and to discuss relationships between nutrient recycling, proteolysis, and autophagy.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=THESEUS1 modulates cell wall stiffness and abscisic acid production in Arabidopsis thaliana;,citation_abstract=Plant cells can be distinguished from animal cells by their cell walls and high-turgor pressure. Although changes in turgor and the stiffness of cell walls seem coordinated, we know little about the mechanism responsible for coordination. Evidence has accumulated that plants, like yeast, have a dedicated cell wall integrity maintenance mechanism. It monitors the functional integrity of the wall and maintains integrity through adaptive responses induced by cell wall damage arising during growth, development, and interactions with the environment. These adaptive responses include osmosensitive induction of phytohormone production, defense responses, as well as changes in cell wall composition and structure. Here, we investigate how the cell wall integrity maintenance mechanism coordinates changes in cell wall stiffness and turgor in Arabidopsis thaliana. We show that the production of abscisic acid (ABA), the phytohormone-modulating turgor pressure, and responses to drought depend on the presence of a functional cell wall. We find that the cell wall integrity sensor THESEUS1 modulates mechanical properties of walls, turgor loss point, ABA biosynthesis, and ABA-controlled processes. We identify RECEPTOR-LIKE PROTEIN 12 as a component of cell wall integrity maintenance–controlling, cell wall damage–induced jasmonic acid (JA) production.

Measuring oxidative enzyme activities in soils is more problematic than assaying hydrolytic enzyme activities because of the non-specific, free radical nature of the reactions and complex interactions between enzymes, assay substrates, and the soil matrix. We compared three substrates commonly used to assay phenol oxidase and peroxidase in soil: pyrogallol (PYGL, 1,2,3-trihydroxybenzene), l-DOPA (l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine), and ABTS (2,2’-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid). We measured substrate oxidation in three soils across a pH gradient from 3.0 to 10.0 to determine the pH optimum for each substrate. In addition, we compared activities across 17 soils using the three substrates. In general, activities on the substrates followed the trend PYGL&amp;amp;amp;gt;. l-DOPA&amp;gt;ABTS and were inversely related to substrate redox potential. PYGL and ABTS were not suitable substrates at pH>5, and ABTS oxidation often declined with addition of peroxide to the assay. Absolute and relative oxidation rates varied widely among substrates in relation to soil type and assay pH. We also tested whether autoclaved or combusted soils could be used as negative controls for the influence of abiotic factors (e.g., soil mineralogy) on oxidative activity. However, neither autoclaving nor combustion produced reliable negative controls because substrate oxidation still occurred; in some cases, these treatments enhanced substrate oxidation rates. For broad scale studies, we recommend that investigators use all three substrates to assess soil oxidation potentials. For focused studies, we recommend evaluating substrates before choosing a single option, and we recommend assays at both the soil pH and a reference pH (e.g., pH 5.0) to determine the effect of assay pH on oxidase activity. These recommendations should contribute to greater comparability of oxidase potential activities across studies. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.;,citation_author=Christopher E. Bach;,citation_author=Daniel D.

Furthermore, the silencing experiments revealed that multiple proteases play a role in cell death and immune response against avirulent and virulent pathogens. Among these 153 proteases, 34 modulated the hypersensitive cell death response caused by infection with an avirulent pathogen, and 16 proteases affected disease symptom development caused by a virulent pathogen.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Seed abscission and fruit dehiscence required for seed dispersal rely on similar genetic networks;,citation_abstract=Seed dispersal is an essential trait that enables colonization of new favorable habitats, ensuring species survival. In plants with dehiscent fruits, such as Arabidopsis, seed dispersal depends on two processes: the separation of the fruit valves that protect the seeds (fruit dehiscence), and the detachment of the seeds from the funiculus connecting them to the mother plant (seed abscission). The key factors required to establish a proper lignin pattern for fruit dehiscence are SHATTERPROOF1 and 2 (SHP1and SHP2). In this work we demonstrate that the SHPs closely related gene SEEDSTICK (STK) is a key factor required to establish the proper lignin pattern in the seed abscission zone but in an opposite way. We show that STK acts as a repressor of lignin deposition in the seed abscission zone through the direct repression of HECATE3 while the SHPs promote lignin deposition in the valve margins by the activation of INDEHISCENT. The interactions of STK with the SEUSS co-repressor determine the difference in the way STK and SHPs control the lignification patterns. Despite this difference in the molecular control of lignification during seed abscission and fruit dehiscence, we show that the genetic networks regulating these two developmental pathways are highly conserved.;,citation_author=Vicente Balanzà;,citation_author=Irma Roig-Villanova;,citation_author=Maurizio Di Marzo;,citation_author=Simona Masiero;,citation_author=Lucia Colombo;,citation_publication_date=2016-01;,citation_cover_date=2016-01;,citation_year=2016;,citation_issue=18;,citation_doi=10.1242/dev.135202;,citation_issn=1477-9129, 0950-1991;,citation_volume=143;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Development;">

The economic value of cotton fiber lies in its length and quality. The multifunctional laccase enzymes play important roles in cell elongation, lignification and pigmentation in plants and could play crucial role in cotton fiber quality. Genome-wide analysis of cultivated allotetraploid (G. hirsutum) and its progenitor diploid (G. arboreum and G. raimondii) cotton species identified 84, 44 and 46 laccase genes, respectively. Analysis of chromosomal location, phylogeny, conserved domain and physical properties showed highly conserved nature of laccases across three cotton species. Gene expression, enzymatic activity and biochemical analysis of developing cotton fibers was performed using G. arboreum species. Of the total 44, 40 laccases showed expression during different stages of fiber development. The higher enzymatic activity of laccases correlated with higher lignin content at 25 DPA (Days Post Anthesis). Further, analysis of cotton fiber phenolic compounds showed an overall decrease at 25 DPA indicating possible incorporation of these substrates into lignin polymer during secondary cell wall biosynthesis. Overall data indicate significant roles of laccases in cotton fiber development, and presents an excellent opportunity for manipulation of fiber development and quality. © The Author(s) 2016.;,citation_author=Vimal Kumar Balasubramanian;,citation_author=Krishan Mohan Rai;,citation_author=Sandi Win Thu;,citation_author=Mei Mei Hii;,citation_author=Venugopal Mendu;,citation_publication_date=2016;,citation_cover_date=2016;,citation_year=2016;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1038/srep34309;,citation_issn=2045-2322;,citation_volume=6;,citation_journal_title=Sci.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A rapid and quantitative safranin-based fluorescent microscopy method to evaluate cell wall lignification;,citation_abstract=One of the main characteristics of plant cells is the presence of the cell wall located outside the plasma membrane. In particular cells, this wall can be reinforced by lignin, a polyphenolic polymer that plays a central role for vascular plants, conferring hydrophobicity to conducting tissues and mechanical support for upright growth. Lignin has been studied extensively by a range of different techniques, including anatomical and morphological analyses using dyes to characterize the polymer localization in situ. With the constant improvement of imaging techniques, it is now possible to revisit old qualitative techniques and adapt them to obtain efficient, highly resolutive, quantitative, fast and safe methodologies. In this study, we revisit and exploit the potential of fluorescent microscopy coupled to safranin-O staining to develop a quantitative approach for lignin content determination. The developed approach is based on ratiometric emission measurements and the development of an imagej macro. To demonstrate the potential of our methodology compared with other commonly used lignin reagents, we demonstrated the use of safranin-O staining to evaluate and compare lignin contents in previously characterized Arabidopsis thaliana lignin biosynthesis mutants. In addition, the analysis of lignin content and spatial distribution in the Arabidopsis laccase mutant also provided new biological insights into the effects of laccase gene downregulation in different cell types. Our safranin-O-based methodology, also validated for Linum usitatissimum (flax), Zea mays (maize) and Populus tremula x alba (poplar), significantly improves and speeds up anatomical and developmental investigations of lignin, which we hope will contribute to new discoveries in many areas of cell wall plant research.;,citation_author=Fabien Baldacci-Cresp;,citation_author=Corentin Spriet;,citation_author=Laure Twyffels;,citation_author=Anne-Sophie Blervacq;,citation_author=Godfrey Neutelings;,citation_author=Marie Baucher;,citation_author=Simon Hawkins;,citation_publication_date=2020;,citation_cover_date=2020;,citation_year=2020;,citation_issue=5;,citation_doi=10.1111/tpj.14675;,citation_issn=1365-313X;,citation_volume=102;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Plant J.;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Syringyl Lignin Is Unaltered by Severe Sinapyl Alcohol Dehydrogenase Suppression in Tobacco;,citation_abstract=The manipulation of lignin could, in principle, facilitate efficient biofuel production from plant biomass. Despite intensive study of the lignin pathway, uncertainty exists about the enzyme catalyzing the last step in syringyl (S) monolignol biosynthesis, the reduction of sinapaldehyde to sinapyl alcohol. Traditional schemes of the pathway suggested that both guaiacyl (G) and S monolignols are produced by a single substrate-versatile enzyme, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD). This was challenged by the discovery of a novel sinapyl alcohol dehydrogenase (SAD) that preferentially uses sinapaldehyde as a substrate and that was claimed to regulate S lignin biosynthesis in angiosperms. Consequently, most pathway schemes now show SAD (or SAD and CAD) at the sinapaldehyde reduction step, although functional evidence is lacking. We cloned SAD from tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) and suppressed it in transgenic plants using RNA interference–inducing vectors. Characterization of lignin in the woody stems shows no change to content, composition, or structure, and S lignin is normal. By contrast, plants additionally suppressed in CAD have changes to lignin structure and S:G ratio and have increased sinapaldehyde in lignin, similar to plants suppressed in CAD alone. These data demonstrate that CAD, not SAD, is the enzyme responsible for S lignin biosynthesis in woody angiosperm xylem.;,citation_author=Abdellah Barakate;,citation_author=Jennifer Stephens;,citation_author=Alison Goldie;,citation_author=William N.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Cytosolic invertases contribute to cellulose biosynthesis and influence carbon partitioning in seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana;,citation_abstract=In plants, UDP-glucose is the direct precursor for cellulose biosynthesis, and can be converted into other NDP-sugars required for the biosynthesis of wall matrix polysaccharides. UDP-glucose is generated from sucrose by two distinct metabolic pathways. The first pathway is the direct conversion of sucrose to UDP-glucose and fructose by sucrose synthase. The second pathway involves sucrose hydrolysis by cytosolic invertase (CINV), conversion of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate and glucose-1-phosphate, and UDP-glucose generation by UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (UGP). Previously, Barratt et al. (Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA, 106, 2009 and 13124) have found that an Arabidopsis double mutant lacking CINV1 and CINV2 displayed drastically reduced growth. Whether this reduced growth is due to deficient cell wall production caused by limited UDP-glucose supply, pleiotropic effects, or both, remained unresolved. Here, we present results indicating that the CINV/UGP pathway contributes to anisotropic growth and cellulose biosynthesis in Arabidopsis. Biochemical and imaging data demonstrate that cinv1 cinv2 seedlings are deficient in UDP-glucose production, exhibit abnormal cellulose biosynthesis and microtubule properties, and have altered cellulose organization without substantial changes to matrix polysaccharide composition, suggesting that the CINV/UGP pathway is a key metabolic route to UDP-glucose synthesis in Arabidopsis. Furthermore, differential responses of cinv1 cinv2 seedlings to exogenous sugar supplementation support a function of CINVs in influencing carbon partitioning in Arabidopsis. From these data and those of previous studies, we conclude that CINVs serve central roles in cellulose biosynthesis and carbon allocation in Arabidopsis.;,citation_author=William J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The cell biology of lignification in higher plants;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Lignin is a polyphenolic polymer that strengthens and waterproofs the cell wall of specialized plant cell types. Lignification is part of the normal differentiation programme and functioning of specific cell types, but can also be triggered as a response to various biotic and abiotic stresses in cells that would not otherwise be lignifying. SCOPE: Cell wall lignification exhibits specific characteristics depending on the cell type being considered. These characteristics include the timing of lignification during cell differentiation, the palette of associated enzymes and substrates, the sub-cellular deposition sites, the monomeric composition and the cellular autonomy for lignin monomer production. This review provides an overview of the current understanding of lignin biosynthesis and polymerization at the cell biology level. CONCLUSIONS: The lignification process ranges from full autonomy to complete co-operation depending on the cell type. The different roles of lignin for the function of each specific plant cell type are clearly illustrated by the multiple phenotypic defects exhibited by knock-out mutants in lignin synthesis, which may explain why no general mechanism for lignification has yet been defined. The range of phenotypic effects observed include altered xylem sap transport, loss of mechanical support, reduced seed protection and dispersion, and/or increased pest and disease susceptibility.;,citation_author=Jaime Barros;,citation_author=Henrik Serk;,citation_author=Irene Granlund;,citation_author=Edouard Pesquet;,citation_publication_date=2015;,citation_cover_date=2015;,citation_year=2015;,citation_issue=7;,citation_doi=10.1093/aob/mcv046;,citation_isbn=1095-8290 (Electronic){\textbackslash}r0305-7364 (Linking);,citation_issn=10958290;,citation_pmid=25878140;,citation_volume=115;,citation_journal_title=Ann.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Role of bifunctional ammonia-lyase in grass cell wall biosynthesis;,citation_abstract=L-Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) is the first enzyme in the biosynthesis of phenylpropanoid-derived plant compounds such as flavonoids, coumarins and the cell wall polymer lignin. The cell walls of grasses possess higher proportions of syringyl (S)-rich lignins and high levels of esterified coumaric acid compared with those of dicotyledonous plants, and PAL from grasses can also possess tyrosine ammonia-lyase (TAL) activity, the reason for which has remained unclear. Using phylogenetic, transcriptomic and in vitro biochemical analyses, we identified a single homotetrameric bifunctional ammonia-lyase (PTAL) among eight BdPAL enzymes in the model grass species Brachypodium distachyon. (13)C isotope labelling experiments along with BdPTAL1-downregulation in transgenic plants showed that the TAL activity of BdPTAL1 can provide nearly half of the total lignin deposited in Brachypodium, with a preference for S-lignin and wall-bound coumarate biosynthesis, indicating that PTAL function is linked to the characteristic features of grass cell walls. Furthermore, isotope dilution experiments suggest that the pathways to lignin from L-phenylalanine and L-tyrosine are distinct beyond the formation of 4-coumarate, supporting the organization of lignin synthesis enzymes in one or more metabolons.;,citation_author=Jaime Barros;,citation_author=Juan C.

Here we describe an enzyme catalyzing the direct 3-hydroxylation of 4-coumarate to caffeate in lignin biosynthesis as a bifunctional peroxidase that oxidizes both ascorbate and 4-coumarate at comparable rates. A combination of biochemical and genetic evidence in the model plants Brachypodium distachyon and Arabidopsis thaliana supports a role for this coumarate 3-hydroxylase (C3H) in the early steps of lignin biosynthesis. The subsequent efficient O-methylation of caffeate to ferulate in grasses is substantiated by in vivo biochemical assays.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Overexpression of a BAHD Acyltransferase, OsAt10, Alters Rice Cell Wall Hydroxycinnamic Acid Content and Saccharification;,citation_abstract=Grass cell wall properties influence food, feed, and biofuel feedstock usage efficiency. The glucuronoarabinoxylan of grass cell walls is esterified with the phenylpropanoid-derived hydroxycinnamic acids ferulic acid (FA) and para-coumaric acid (p-CA). Feruloyl esters undergo oxidative coupling with neighboring phenylpropanoids on glucuronoarabinoxylan and lignin. Examination of rice (Oryza sativa) mutants in a grass-expanded and -diverged clade of BAHD acyl-coenzyme A-utilizing transferases identified four mutants with altered cell wall FA or p-CA contents. Here, we report on the effects of overexpressing one of these genes, OsAt10 (LOC_Os06g39390), in rice. An activation-tagged line, OsAT10-D1, shows a 60% reduction in matrix polysaccharide-bound FA and an approximately 300% increase in p-CA in young leaf tissue but no discernible phenotypic alterations in vegetative development, lignin content, or lignin composition. Two additional independent OsAt10 overexpression lines show similar changes in FA and p-CA content. Cell wall fractionation and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry experiments isolate the cell wall alterations in the mutant to ester conjugates of a five-carbon sugar with p-CA and FA. These results suggest that OsAT10 is a p-coumaroyl coenzyme A transferase involved in glucuronoarabinoxylan modification. Biomass from OsAT10-D1 exhibits a 20% to 40% increase in saccharification yield depending on the assay.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Leucine aminopeptidase from Arabidopsis thaliana;,citation_abstract=Leucine aminopeptidases are exopeptidases which are presumably involved in the processing and regular turnover of intracellular proteins; however, their precise function in cellular metabolism remains to be established. Towards this goal, a full-length complementary DNA encoding a plant leucine aminopeptidase was isolated from a cDNA library of Arabidopsis thaliana and sequenced. The nucleotide sequence showed 49.5% identity to the Escherichia coli xerB-encoded leucine aminopeptidase. Sequence analysis revealed that the cDNA encodes a polypeptide of 520 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 54506 Da. The C-terminal part (amino acids 200-520) of the deduced amino acid sequence showed 43.8% sequence identity to the xerB-encoded leucine aminopeptidase and 42.6% sequence identity to the amino acid sequence of bovine lens leucine aminopeptidase (EC 3.4.1 1.1). No sequence similarity (not even over short sequence elements) was observed with any other known peptidase or proteinase sequence. The cDNA was expressed as a fusion protein from the 1acZ promoter in E. coli. Enzymatic analysis proved that the cloned cDNA encoded an active leucine aminopeptidase. The properties of this enzyme, including metal require- ments, inhibitor sensitivity, pH optimum and the remarkable temperature stability, are very similar to those reported for leucine aminopeptidases from other tissues. Amino acids involved in metal and substrate binding in bovine lens aminopeptidase are completely conserved in the plant enzyme as well as in the XerB protein. Our results show that leucine aminopeptidases form a superfamily of highly conserved enzymes, spanning the evolutionary period from the bacteria to animals and higher plants.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Endocytosis of Cellulose Synthase in Arabidopsis Is Dependent on M2, a Clathrin-Mediated Endocytosis Adaptin;,citation_abstract=Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is the best-characterized type of endocytosis in eukaryotic cells. Plants appear to possess all of the molecular components necessary to carry out CME; however, functional characterization of the components is still in its infancy. A yeast two-hybrid screen identified \mu2 as a putative interaction partner of CELLULOSE SYNTHASE6 (CESA6). Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) \mu2 is homologous to the medium subunit 2 of the mammalian ADAPTOR PROTEIN COMPLEX2 (AP2). In mammals, the AP2 complex acts as the central hub of CME by docking to the plasma membrane while concomitantly recruiting cargo proteins, clathrin triskelia, and accessory proteins to the sites of endocytosis. We confirmed that \mu2 interacts with multiple CESA proteins through the \mu-homology domain of \mu2, which is involved in specific interactions with endocytic cargo proteins in mammals. Consistent with its role in mediating the endocytosis of cargos at the plasma membrane, \mu2-YELLOW FLUORESCENT PROTEIN localized to transient foci at the plasma membrane, and loss of \mu2 resulted in defects in bulk endocytosis. Furthermore, loss of \mu2 led to increased accumulation of YELLOW FLUORESCENT PROTEIN-CESA6 particles at the plasma membrane. Our results suggest that CESA represents a new class of CME cargo proteins and that plant cells might regulate cellulose synthesis by controlling the abundance of active CESA complexes at the plasma membrane through CME.;,citation_author=Logan Bashline;,citation_author=Shundai Li;,citation_author=Charles T.

Its non-catalytic donut-shaped core includes 9 subunits that associate with the 3’ to 5’ exoribonucleases Rrp6, and Rrp44/Dis3, a subunit that also catalyzes endoribonuclease activity. Although recent structures and biochemical studies of RNA bound exosomes from S. cerevisiae revealed that the Exo9 central channel guides RNA to either Rrp6 or Rrp44 using partially overlapping and mutually exclusive paths, several issues related to RNA recruitment remain. Here, we identify activities for the highly basic Rrp6 C-terminal tail that we term the ’lasso’ because it binds RNA and stimulates ribonuclease activities associated with Rrp44 and Rrp6 within the 11-subunit nuclear exosome. Stimulation is dependent on the Exo9 central channel, and the lasso contributes to degradation and processing activities of exosome substrates in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we present evidence that the Rrp6 lasso may be a conserved feature of the eukaryotic RNA exosome.;,citation_author=R.

Optimal conditions for enzymatic studies were determined to be pH 6.0-6.5 and 28 C. The partially purified PPO presented high activity toward catechol (Vmax 3.42 U mL-1 and Km 6.47 mM) and 4-methylcatechol (Vmax 3.01 U mL-1 and Km 0.15 mM) and low activity toward phenol being classified as a catecholase type polyphenol oxidase.

We have down-regulated CAD in transgenic poplar (Populus tremula X Populus alba) by both antisense and co-suppression strategies. Several antisense and sense CAD transgenic poplars had an approximately 70% reduced CAD activity that was associated with a red coloration of the xylem tissue. Neither the lignin amount nor the lignin monomeric composition (syringyl/guaiacyl) were significantly modified. However, phloroglucinol-HCl staining was different in the down-regulated CAD plants, suggesting changes in the number of aldehyde units in the lignin. Furthermore, the reactivity of the cell wall toward alkali treatment was altered: a lower amount of lignin was found in the insoluble, saponified residue and more lignin could be precipitated from the soluble alkali fraction. Moreover, large amounts of phenolic compounds, vanillin and especially syringaldehyde, were detected in the soluble alkali fraction of the CAD down-regulated poplars. Alkaline pulping experiments on 3-month-old trees showed a reduction of the kappa number without affecting the degree of cellulose degradation.

The lignin quantity remained unchanged, but the lignin composition, as determined by thioacidolysis, was altered.

Lignin in cell walls of switchgrass, and other lignocellulosic feedstocks, severely limits the accessibility of cell wall carbohydrates to enzymatic breakdown into fermentable sugars and subsequently biofuels. Low-lignin transgenic switchgrass plants produced by the down-regulation of caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (COMT), a lignin biosynthetic enzyme, were analysed in the field for two growing seasons. COMT transcript abundance, lignin content and the syringyl/guaiacyl lignin monomer ratio were consistently lower in the COMT-down-regulated plants throughout the duration of the field trial. In general, analyses with fully established plants harvested during the second growing season produced results that were similar to those observed in previous greenhouse studies with these plants. Sugar release was improved by up to 34% and ethanol yield by up to 28% in the transgenic lines relative to controls. Additionally, these results were obtained using senesced plant material harvested at the end of the growing season, compared with the young, green tissue that was used in the greenhouse experiments. Another important finding was that transgenic plants were not more susceptible to rust (Puccinia emaculata).

Uniform silencing was achieved without lethality using miRNA trigger- TAS overexpression fusion cassettes to generate 21-nt atasiRNA. Plant transgenic technologies are very important for basic plant research and biotechnology. Artificial trans-acting small interfering RNA (atasiRNA) represents an attractive platform with certain advantages over other silencing approaches, such as hairpin RNA, artificial microRNA (amiRNA), and virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS). In this study, we developed two types of constructs for atasiRNA-mediated gene silencing in plants. To functionally validate our constructs, we chose TAS1a as a test model. Type 1 constructs had miR173-precursor sequence fused with TAS1a locus driven by single promoter-terminator cassette, which simplified the expression cassette and resulted in uniform gene silencing. Type 2 constructs contained two separate cassettes for miR173 and&nbsp;TAS1a&nbsp;co-expression. The constructs in each type&nbsp;were further improved by deploying the XcmI-based TC-cloning system for highly efficient directional cloning of short DNA fragments encoding atasiRNAs into TAS1a locus.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Origins of covalent linkages within the lignin–carbohydrate network of biomass;,citation_abstract=Covalent linkages between lignin and the surrounding carbohydrate network, often referred to as lignin–carbohydrate complexes (LCCs), have been proposed to affect the organization of the biomass microstructure and directly correlate with the recalcitrant nature of biomass. However, the existence and frequency of these LCC linkages remain controversial and largely unknown, primarily due to the harsh experimental techniques available to characterize them. During the predominant lignin polymerization pathway a reactive intermediate is formed. Though this intermediate can covalently bind to the surrounding cellulose/hemicellulose matrix, it has been traditionally assumed to react exclusively with water, leading to purely physical interactions between lignin and cellulose/hemicellulose in the cell wall. This work, for the first time, provides direct evidence of the molecular mechanism of the formation of benzyl ether and benzyl ester LCC linkages via the speculated lignin polymerization pathway. The formation of these LCC linkages showed thermodynamic favorability, while remaining kinetically facile, compared to the previously assumed mechanism of the lignin intermediate reacting with water. The present work suggests that the surrounding carbohydrate matrix could play a role in the organization of lignin deposition and these covalent linkages could be a key factor in biomass recalcitrance.;,citation_author=Seth Beck;,citation_author=Phillip Choi;,citation_author=Samir H.

Recent studies identified cellulose as an important component of seed mucilage in various species. Cellulose is deposited as a set of rays that radiate from the seed upon mucilage extrusion, serving to anchor the pectic component of seed mucilage to the seed surface. Using transcriptome data encompassing the course of seed development, we identified COBRA-LIKE2 (COBL2), a member of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored COBRA-LIKE gene family in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), as coexpressed with other genes involved in cellulose deposition in mucilage secretory cells. Disruption of the COBL2 gene results in substantial reduction in the rays of cellulose present in seed mucilage, along with an increased solubility of the pectic component of the mucilage. Light birefringence demonstrates a substantial decrease in crystalline cellulose deposition into the cellulosic rays of the cobl2 mutants. Moreover, crystalline cellulose deposition into the radial cell walls and the columella appears substantially compromised, as demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy and in situ quantification of light birefringence. Overall, the cobl2 mutants display about 40% reduction in whole-seed crystalline cellulose content compared with the wild type.

As a result of their roles in nutrient cycling and plant diversity, plant-soil interactions should be a major focus of ecological studies on lignin-modified plants. However, most studies have been decomposition studies conducted in a single soil or in sterile soil. Thus, we understand little about plant-soil interactions in living lignin-modified plants. In lignin mutants of three different barley (Hordeum vulgare) cultivars and their corresponding wild-types associated with three different soil microbial communities, we asked: do plant-soil microbiome interactions influence the lignin content of plants?; does a mutation in lignin production alter the outcome of plant-soil microbiome interactions?; does the outcome of plant-soil microbiome interactions depend on host genotype or the presence of a mutation altering lignin production? In roots, the soil community explained 6% of the variation in lignin content, but, in shoots, the soil community explained 21% of the variation in lignin content and was the only factor influencing lignin content. Neither genotype nor mutations in lignin production explained associations with fungi. Lignin content changes in response to a plant’s soil microbial community, and may be a defensive response to particular components of the soil community.;,citation_author=Alison E.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Water ascent in trees and lianas: The cohesion-tension theory revisited in the wake of Otto Renner;,citation_abstract=The cohesion-tension theory of water ascent (C-T) has been challenged over the past decades by a large body of experimental evidence obtained by means of several minimum or non-invasive techniques. The evidence strongly suggests that land plants acquire water through interplay of several mechanisms covered by the multi-force theory of (U. Zimmermann et al. New Phytologist 162: 575–615, 2004). The diversity of mechanisms includes, for instance, water acquisition by inverse transpiration and thermodynamically uphill transmembrane water secretion by cation-chloride cotransporters (L.H. Wegner, Progress in Botany 76:109–141, 2014). This whole plant perspective was opened by Otto Renner at the beginning of the last century who supported experimentally the strictly xylem-bound C-T mechanism, yet anticipated that the water ascent involves both the xylem conduit and parenchyma tissues. The survey also illustrates the known paradigm that new techniques generate new insights, as well as a paradigm experienced by Max Planck that a new scientific idea is not welcomed by the community instantly.;,citation_author=Friedrich-Wilhelm Bentrup;,citation_publication_date=2017-03;,citation_cover_date=2017-03;,citation_year=2017;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1007/s00709-016-1009-4;,citation_issn=1615-6102;,citation_volume=254;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Protoplasma;">

To test the impact of laccase on pulp bleaching we performed studies with P. cinnabarinus wild type (WT) and its laccase-less mutants on softwood kraft pulp (SWKP) in both static and shake flask cultures. In the static pulp cultures (at 20% pulp consistency in water), after 25 days incubation, P. cinnabarinus wild type increased the pulp brightness from 35 to 59% ISO, and decreased the kappa number from 15 to 5.7. However P. cinnabarinus laccase-less mutants 51 and 85 increased the brightness to only 40.6 and 40.7, and decreased the kappa number to 12 and 13.4, respectively. In the shake flask cultures with pulp suspended in water (at 2% consistency), the wild type increased pulp brightness from 38 to 52.4% ISO, and decreased the kappa number from 12 to 5.9.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Crystal structure analysis of peroxidase from the palm tree Chamaerops excelsa;,citation_abstract=Palm tree peroxidases are known to be very stable enzymes and the peroxidase from the Chamaerops excelsa (CEP), which has a high pH and thermal stability, is no exception. To date, the structural and molecular events underscoring such biochemical behavior have not been explored in depth. In order to identify the structural characteristics accounting for the high stability of palm tree peroxidases, we solved and refined the X-ray structure of native CEP at a resolution of 2.6&nbsp;Å. The CEP structure has an overall fold typical of plant peroxidases and confirmed the conservation of characteristic structural elements such as the heme group and calcium ions. At the same time the structure revealed important modifications in the amino acid residues in the vicinity of the exposed heme edge region, involved in substrate binding, that could account for the morphological variations among palm tree peroxidases through the disruption of molecular interactions at the second binding site. These modifications could alleviate the inhibition of enzymatic activity caused by molecular interactions at the latter binding site. Comparing the CEP crystallographic model described here with other publicly available peroxidase structures allowed the identification of a noncovalent homodimer assembly held together by a number of ionic and hydrophobic interactions. We demonstrate, that this dimeric arrangement results in a more stable protein quaternary structure through stabilization of the regions that are highly dynamic in other peroxidases. In addition, we resolved five N-glycosylation sites, which might also contribute to enzyme stability and resistance against proteolytic cleavage.;,citation_author=Amanda Bernardes;,citation_author=Larissa C.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Methionine aminopeptidases type I and type II are essential to control cell proliferation;,citation_abstract=The dependence of cell growth on methionine aminopeptidase (MetAP) function in bacteria and yeast is firmly established. Here we report experimental evidence that the control of cell proliferation in mammalian cells is directly linked and strictly dependent on the activity of both MetAP-1 and MetAP-2. The targeted downregulation of either methionine aminopeptidase MetAP-1 or MetAP-2 protein expression by small interfering RNA (siRNA) significantly inhibited the proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) (70%-80%), while A549 human lung carcinoma cell proliferation was less inhibited (20%-30%). The cellular levels of MetAP-2 enzyme were measured after MetAP-2 siRNA treatment and found to decrease over time from 4 to 96 h, while rapid and complete depletion of MetAP-2 enzyme activity was observed after 4 h treatment with two pharmacological inhibitors of MetAP-2, PPI-2458 and fumagillin. When HUVEC and A549 cells were treated simultaneously with MetAP-2 siRNA and PPI-2458, or fumagillin, which irreversibly inhibit MetAP-2 enzyme activity, no additive effect on maximum growth inhibition was observed. This strongly suggests that MetAP-2 is the single critical cellular enzyme affected by either MetAP-2 targeting approach. Most strikingly, despite their significantly different sensitivity to growth inhibition after targeting of either MetAP-1 or MetAP-2, HUVEC, and A549 cells, which were made functionally deficient in both MetAP-1 and MetAP-2 were completely or almost completely inhibited in their growth, respectively. This closely resembled the observed growth inhibition in genetically double-deficient map1map2 yeast strains. These results suggest that MetAP-1 and MetAP-2 have essential functions in the control of mammalian cell proliferation and that MetAP-dependent growth control is evolutionarily highly conserved.;,citation_author=Sylvie G.

We addressed this issue by studying laccase T-DNA insertion mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana. We identified two genes, LAC4 and LAC17, which are strongly expressed in stems. LAC17 was mainly expressed in the interfascicular fibers, whereas LAC4 was expressed in vascular bundles and interfascicular fibers. We produced two double mutants by crossing the LAC17 (lac17) mutant with two LAC4 mutants (lac4-1 and lac4-2). The single and double mutants grew normally in greenhouse conditions. The single mutants had moderately low lignin levels, whereas the stems of lac4-1 lac17 and lac4-2 lac17 mutants had lignin contents that were 20 and 40% lower than those of the control, respectively. These lower lignin levels resulted in higher saccharification yields. Thioacidolysis revealed that disrupting LAC17 principally affected the deposition of G lignin units in the interfascicular fibers and that complementation of lac17 with LAC17 restored a normal lignin profile. This study provides evidence that both LAC4 and LAC17 contribute to the constitutive lignification of Arabidopsis stems and that LAC17 is involved in the deposition of G lignin units in fibers.;,citation_author=S.

We purified from the white rot fungus Trametes versicolor a laccase that exists as five different isozymes, depending on glycosylation. The 2.4 Å resolution structure of the most abundant isozyme of the glycosylated enzyme was solved. The four copper atoms are present, and it is the first crystal structure of a laccase in its active form. The crystallized enzyme binds 2,5-xylidine, which was used as a laccase inducer in the fungus culture. This arylamine is a very weak reducing substrate of the enzyme. The cavity enclosing 2,5-xylidine is rather wide, allowing the accommodation of substrates of various sizes. Several amino acid residues make hydrophobic interactions with the aromatic ring of the ligand. In addition, two charged or polar residues interact with its amino group. The first one is an histidine that also coordinates the copper that functions as the primary electron acceptor. The second is an aspartate conserved among fungal laccases. The purified enzyme can oxidize various hydroxylated compounds of the phenylurea family of herbicides that we synthesized. These phenolic substrates have better affinities at pH 5 than at pH 3, which could be related to the 2,5-xylidine binding by the aspartate.

The current study employed V. dahliae (Vd) toxin as pathogen-free model system to induce stress on cotton callus growth, and its amelioration was investigated using 24-epibrassinolide (EBR). Results revealed that EBR has ameliorative effects against Vd toxin with greater seen effect when callus was treated with EBR prior to its exposure to Vd toxin (pre-EBR treatment) than EBR applied along with Vd toxin simultaneously (co-EBR treatment). Pre-EBR-treated calli remained green, while 65 and 90% callus browning was observed in co-EBR- and Vd toxin-alone-treated callus, respectively. Likewise, the fresh weight of the pre-EBR-treated callus was 52% higher than Vd toxin-alone treatment, whereas this increase was only 23% in co-EBR-treated callus. Meanwhile, EBR treatment of the cotton callus has also increased the contents of chlorophylls a and b, carotenoids, total phenols, flavonoids, soluble sugars, and proteins and increased the activity of enzymes involved in secondary metabolism like polyphenol oxidase (PPO), phenylalanine ammonialyase (PAL), cinnamyl alchol dehydrogenase (CAD), and shikimate dehydrogenase (SKDH) over Vd toxin-alone treatment with higher increments being observed in pre-EBR-treated callus. Furthermore, EBR treatment mimicked the DNA damage and improved the structure of mitochondria, granum, stroma thylakoids, and the attachment of ribosomes with the endoplasmic reticulum.

However, the mechanisms controlling and localizing regions of growth remain essentially unknown. Root hair formation involves the induction of a localized cell expansion in the lateral wall of a root epidermal cell. This expanded region then enters a second phase of localized growth called tip growth. Root hair formation therefore provides a model in which to study the cellular events involved in regulating localized growth in plants. Confocal ratio imaging of the pH of the cell wall revealed an acidification at the root hair initiation site. This acidification was present from the first morphological indications of localized growth, but not before, and was maintained to the point where the process of root hair initiation ceased and tip growth began. Preventing the wall acidification with pH buffers arrested the initiation process but growth resumed when the wall was returned to an acidic pH. Cytoplasmic pH was found to be elevated from approximately 7.3 to 7. 7 at the initiation site, and this elevation coincided with the acidification of the wall. Preventing the localized increase in cytoplasmic pH with 10 mM butyrate however did not inhibit either the wall acidification or the initiation process. In contrast, there was no detectable gradient in pH associated with the apex of tip growing root hairs, but both elevated apoplastic pH and butyrate treatment irreversibly inhibited the tip growth process. Thus the processes of tip growth and initiation of root hairs show differences in their pH requirements. These results highlight the role of localized control of apoplastic pH in the control of cell architecture and morphogenesis in plants.;,citation_author=T. N. Bibikova;,citation_author=T.

Our results suggest that both the assumptions going into and the predictions arising from this hypothesis do not stand closer scrutiny and may misguide experimentalists.

Signaling mediated by the plant steroid hormones brassinosteroids (BR) plays a central role in coordinating cell wall status and cell growth, and alterations in the cell wall BR feedback loop leads to life-threatening defects in tissue and cellular integrity. How the status of the cell wall is relayed to BR signaling remains largely unclear. Increasing evidence shows that RAPID ALKALANIZATION FACTORs (RALFs), a class of secreted peptides, play structural and signaling roles at the cell surface. Here we show that perception of RALF23 promotes the formation and signaling of the main BR receptor complex formed by BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1 (BRI1) and BRI1 BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE1 BRASSINOSTEROID ASSOCIATED KINASE 1 (BAK1). The loss of the plasma membrane localized RALF receptor complex FERONIA (FER) LORELEI LIKE GPI anchor protein 1 (LLG1) leads to defects in cell expansion and anisotropy, as well as uncontrolled BRI1 BAK1 complex formation and signaling. RALF23 bioactivity relies on pectin status and its perception induces changes in pectin composition and the activity of pectin-modifying enzymes.

This has been taken as evidence that isodityrosine acts as a cross-link holding the hydroxyproline-rich glycoprotein extensin in the cell wall. However, acidified chlorite was found to cleave peptide bonds in salt-soluble extensin and in bovine serum albumin (BSA). This invalidates the use of conventional acidified chlorite treatment to provide evidence for isodityrosine cross-links. The ratio of BSA:chlorite was important in determining peptidyl cleavage. At a ratio of 0.75:1.00 (mole amino acid residues/mole chlorite), or higher, peptidyl cleavage was not detected. Furthermore, in samples where a low concentration of radioactive extensin was present, BSA substantially protected the peptide bonds of the extensin against peptidyl cleavage during treatment with acidified chlorite, while not preventing the cleavage of isodityrosine. Therefore, acidified sodium chlorite plus BSA was a more specific reagent for the cleavage of isodityrosine than was acidified chlorite alone. This modified treatment solubilized in intact form the “covalently bound” extensin from cell walls of Capsicum frutescens (chili pepper) suspension cultures, providing new evidence compatible with the view that extensin molecules are held in the cell wall by isodityrosine cross-links.;,citation_author=Karen J.

While tyrosinases accept both mono- and o-diphenols as substrates, only the latter substrate is converted by catechol oxidases. Researchers have been working for decades to elucidate the monophenolase/diphenolase specificity on a structural level and have introduced an early hypothesis that states that the reason for the lack of monophenolase activity in catechol oxidases may be its structurally restricted active site. However, recent structural and biochemical studies of this enzyme class have raised doubts about this theory. Herein, the first crystal structure of a plant tyrosinase (from Juglans regia) is presented. The structure reveals that the distinction between mono- and diphenolase activity does not depend on the degree of restriction of the active site, and thus a more important role for amino acid residues located at the entrance to and in the second shell of the active site is proposed.;,citation_author=Aleksandar Bijelic;,citation_author=Matthias Pretzler;,citation_author=Christian Molitor;,citation_author=Florime Zekiri;,citation_author=Annette Rompel;,citation_publication_date=2015;,citation_cover_date=2015;,citation_year=2015;,citation_issue=49;,citation_doi=10.1002/anie.201506994;,citation_issn=15213773;,citation_pmid=26473311;,citation_volume=54;,citation_journal_title=Angew.

The lignin reduction resulted in ultrastructural differences of the wood and a 10% decrease in wood density. Mechanical properties investigated by tensile tests and dynamic mechanical analysis showed a decrease in stiffness, which could be explained by the lower density.

In this review, we provide an overview of the differences and similarities between phenoloxidases in their protein structure, reaction mechanism, substrate specificity, and functional roles. Using the example of laccases (LACs), we also performed a meta-analysis of enzyme kinetics, a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis and machine-learning based protein structure modelling to link functions, evolution, and structures in this group of phenoloxidases. With these approaches, we generated a framework to explain the reported functional differences between paralogs, while also hinting at the likely diversity of yet undescribed LAC functions.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Playing the field: The molecular basis of fruit morphology-based bet-hedging;,citation_abstract=Extreme weather fluctuations, as well as broader changes in climate, can severely endanger the survival of germinating seedlings. To prevent the total loss of offspring in such scenarios, some plant species hedge their bets by creating multiple types of seed, each with distinct germination behaviors. Some of these seeds will germinate with the first occurrence of favorable conditions—for example, the first rainfall or the beginning of spring. Other seeds remain dormant, forming soil-based seed banks that will gradually germinate over subsequent seasons or years. While such strategies diminish the number of offspring in an ideal environment, they ensure the survival of the population through extreme conditions. This “bet-hedging” can extend to the morphology of the diaspore, which is the seed (or spore) plus tissues, such as the fruit pericarp, that aid seed dispersal. Diaspore polymorphism has independently evolved several times and can confer ecophysiological advantages in unpredictable environments and climates. Crop domestication, on the other hand, actively selected against stochastic seed dormancy—especially as related to diaspore polymorphisms—to increase predictability and yield in controlled environments (Nave et al. 2016).

Two different categories of ERY4 mutant genes were produced and expressed in yeast: (i) mutants carrying C-terminal deletions and (ii) mutants carrying different site-specific mutations at their C-terminus. Investigation of the catalytic properties of the recombinant enzymes indicated that each novel variant acquired different affinities and catalytic activity for various substrates. Our results highlight that C-terminal processing is fundamental for Ery4 laccase enzymatic activities allowing substrate accessibility to the enzyme catalytic core. Apparently, the last 18 amino acids in the C-terminal end of the Ery4 laccase play a critical role in enzyme activity, stability and kinetic and, in particular biochemical and structural data indicate that the K532 residue is fundamental for enzyme activation.

Ray parenchymal cells may function in the lignification of upright tracheids by supplying monolignols. To test this hypothesis, parenchymal ray cells and upright tracheids were dissected with laser-capture microdissection from tangential cryosections of developing xylem of spruce trees. The transcriptome analysis revealed that among the genes involved in processes typical for vascular tissues, genes encoding cell wall biogenesis-related enzymes were highly expressed in both developing tracheids and ray cells. Interestingly, most of the shikimate and monolignol biosynthesis pathway-related genes were equally expressed in both cell types. Nonetheless, 1,073 differentially expressed genes were detected between developing ray cells and tracheids, among which a set of genes expressed only in ray cells was identified. In situ single cell metabolomics of semi-intact plants by picoliter pressure probe-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry detected monolignols and their glycoconjugates in both cell types, indicating that the biosynthetic route for monolignols is active in both upright tracheids and parenchymal ray cells.

The performance of this method is documented by staining one-and two-dimensional patterns of plant leaf proteins.

Yet to understand the spectra, the bands have to be assigned to components and their molecular structures. Although the lignin distribution is easily tracked in plant tissues, the assignment of the spectra is not good enough to allow in-depth analysis of the composition. Assignments of three lignin model compounds were derived from polarization measurements and quantum-chemical computations. Raman spectra of coniferyl alcohol crystals showed orientation dependence, which helped in band assignment. Abietin showed a Raman spectrum that was very similar to the spectrum of coniferyl alcohol, whereas its IR spectrum was very different due to bands of the sugar moiety. The Raman spectrum of coniferyl aldehyde is affected by the crystal order of molecules. All three compounds show much stronger band intensities than unconjugated single aromatic rings, indicating that the bulk of the lignin structure has significantly reduced contribution to Raman band intensities.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Polyphenol oxidase-mediated protection against oxidative stress is not associated with enhanced photosynthetic efficiency;,citation_abstract=© 2015 The Author 2015. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Annals of Botany Company. Background and Aims Polyphenol oxidases (PPOs) catalyse the oxidation of monophenols and/or o-diphenols to highly reactive o-quinones, which in turn interact with oxygen and proteins to form reactive oxygen species (ROS) and typical brown-pigmented complexes. Hence PPOs can affect local levels of oxygen and ROS. Although the currently known substrates are located in the vacuole, the enzyme is targeted to the thylakoid lumen, suggesting a role for PPOs in photosynthesis. The current study was designed to investigate the potential involvement of PPOs in the photosynthetic response to oxidative stress. Methods Photosynthesis (A, Fv/Fm, \PhiPSII, qN, qP, NPQ) was measured in leaves of a wild-type and a low-PPO mutant of red clover (Trifolium pratense ’Milvus’) under control conditions and under a stress treatment designed to induce photooxidative stress: cold/high light (2 ^\circC/580\in\mumol\inm2\ins-1) or 0-10\in\mum methyl viologen. Foliar protein content and oxidation state were also determined. Key Results Photosynthetic performance, and chlorophyll and protein content during 4\ind of cold/high light stress and 3\ind of subsequent recovery under control growth conditions showed similar susceptibility to stress in both lines. However, more extensive oxidative damage to protein in mutants than wild-types was observed after treatment of attached leaves with methyl viologen. In addition, PPO activity could be associated with an increased capacity to dissipate excess energy, but only at relatively low methyl viologen doses. Conclusions The presence of PPO activity in leaves did not correspond to a direct role for the enzyme in the regulation or protection of photosynthesis under cold stress. However, an indication that PPO could be involved in cellular protection against low-level oxidative stress requires further investigation.;,citation_author=Tinne Boeckx;,citation_author=Richard Webster;,citation_author=Ana L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Detection of Potential Chloroplastic Substrates for Polyphenol Oxidase Suggests a Role in Undamaged Leaves;,citation_abstract=© 2017 Boeckx, Winters, Webb and Kingston-Smith. Polyphenol oxidases (PPOs) have a recognized role during pathogen and arthropod attack. As an immediate consequence of such wounding, cellular compartmentation is destroyed allowing the chloroplastic PPO enzyme to interact with vacuolar substrates catalyzing the oxidation of monophenols and/or o-diphenols to o-diquinones. This ultimately results in a reduction in the nutritional value of wounded tissue through the formation of non-digestible secondary melanin pigments. However, the chloroplastic location of PPO enzyme could indicate a role for PPO in undamaged tissues. In this study, a wild-type red clover population exhibiting high leaf PPO activity had significantly higher yield than a low leaf PPO mutant population while leaf isoflavonoids and hydroxycinnammates (PPO substrates) accumulated at similar levels in these plants. These data suggest that the presence of leaf PPO activity affects plant vigor. Understanding how this advantage is conferred requires knowledge of the cellular mechanism, including intra-organellar substrates. Here we present evidence of candidate PPO substrates within chloroplasts of wild-type red clover, including the monophenolic acid, coumaroyl malate, and low levels of the diphenolic acid, phaselic acid (caffeoyl malate). Interestingly, chloroplastic phaselic acid concentration increased significantly under certain growth co nditions. We discuss the implications of this in regard to a potential role for chloroplastic PPO in undamaged leaves.;,citation_author=Tinne Boeckx;,citation_author=Ana Winters;,citation_author=K.

However, knowledge of the regulation of cellulose biosynthesis is still rather limited. Recent studies have shown that the phosphorylation of cellulose synthases (CESAs) may represent a key regulatory event in cellulose production. However, the impact of environmental conditions on the carbon flux of cellulose deposition and on phosphorylation levels of CESAs has not been fully elucidated. Here, we took advantage of gas exchange measurements, isotopic techniques, metabolomics, and quantitative phosphoproteomics to investigate the regulation of cellulose production in Arabidopsis rosette leaves in different photosynthetic contexts (different CO2 mole fractions) or upon light/dark transition. We show that the carbon flux to cellulose production increased with photosynthesis, but not proportionally. The phosphorylation level of several phosphopeptides associated with CESA1 and 3, and several enzymes of sugar metabolism was higher in the light and/or increased with photosynthesis. By contrast, a phosphopeptide (Ser126) associated with CESA5 seemed to be more phosphorylated in the dark.

Genetic disruption of lignin biosynthesis has been proposed as a means to improve forage and bioenergy crops, but frequently results in stunted growth and developmental abnormalities, the mechanisms of which are poorly understood. Here we show that the phenotype of a lignin-deficient Arabidopsis mutant is dependent on the transcriptional co-regulatory complex, Mediator. Disruption of the Mediator complex subunits MED5a (also known as REF4) and MED5b (also known as RFR1) rescues the stunted growth, lignin deficiency and widespread changes in gene expression seen in the phenylpropanoid pathway mutant ref8, without restoring the synthesis of guaiacyl and syringyl lignin subunits. Cell walls of rescued med5a/5b ref8 plants instead contain a novel lignin consisting almost exclusively of p-hydroxyphenyl lignin subunits, and moreover exhibit substantially facilitated polysaccharide saccharification. These results demonstrate that guaiacyl and syringyl lignin subunits are largely dispensable for normal growth and development, implicate Mediator in an active transcriptional process responsible for dwarfing and inhibition of lignin biosynthesis, and suggest that the transcription machinery and signalling pathways responding to cell wall defects may be important targets to include in efforts to reduce biomass recalcitrance.;,citation_author=Nicholas D.

Safranine fluorescently labels the wood cell wall, producing green/yellow fluorescence in the secondary cell wall and red/orange fluorescence in the middle lamella (ML) region. We examined the fluorescence behavior of safranine under blue light excitation using a variety of wood- and fiber-based samples of known composition to interpret the observed color differentiation of different cell wall types. We also examined the basis for the differences in fluorescence emission using spectral confocal microscopy to examine lignin-rich and cellulose-rich cell walls including reaction wood and decayed wood compared to normal wood. Our results indicate that lignin-rich cell walls, such as the ML of tracheids, the secondary wall of compression wood tracheids, and wood decayed by brown rot, tend to fluoresce red or orange, while cellulose-rich cell walls such as resin canals, wood decayed by white rot, cotton fibers and the G-layer of tension wood fibers, tend to fluoresce green/yellow. This variation in fluorescence emission seems to be due to factors including an emission shift toward red wavelengths combined with dye quenching at shorter wavelengths in regions with high lignin content.

The cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) genes involved in lignification are promising targets to improve the cellulose-to-ethanol conversion process. Down-regulation of CAD often induces a reddish coloration of lignified tissues. Based on this observation, we screened a chemically induced population of Brachypodium mutants (Bd21-3 background) for red culm coloration. We identified two mutants (Bd4179 and Bd7591), with mutations in the BdCAD1 gene. The mature stems of these mutants displayed reduced CAD activity and lower lignin content. Their lignins were enriched in 8-O-4- and 4-O-5-coupled sinapaldehyde units, as well as resistant inter-unit bonds and free phenolic groups. By contrast, there was no increase in coniferaldehyde end groups. Moreover, the amount of sinapic acid ester-linked to cell walls was measured for the first time in a lignin-related CAD grass mutant. Functional complementation of the Bd4179 mutant with the wild-type BdCAD1 allele restored the wild-type phenotype and lignification. Saccharification assays revealed that Bd4179 and Bd7591 lines were more susceptible to enzymatic hydrolysis than wild-type plants. Here, we have demonstrated that BdCAD1 is involved in lignification of Brachypodium. We have shown that a single nucleotide change in BdCAD1 reduces the lignin level and increases the degree of branching of lignins through incorporation of sinapaldehyde. These changes make saccharification of cells walls pre-treated with alkaline easier without compromising plant growth.;,citation_author=Madeleine Bouvier D’Yvoire;,citation_author=Oumaya Bouchabke-Coussa;,citation_author=Wannes Voorend;,citation_author=Sébastien Antelme;,citation_author=Laurent Cézard;,citation_author=Frédéric Legée;,citation_author=Philippe Lebris;,citation_author=Sylvain Legay;,citation_author=Caragh Whitehead;,citation_author=Simon J.

Land plants evolved from an ancestral charophycean alga from which they inherited developmental, biochemical, and cell biological attributes.

We analyzed the genome of the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha, a member of a basal land plant lineage. Relative to charophycean algae, land plant genomes are characterized by genes encoding novel biochemical pathways, new phytohormone signaling pathways (notably auxin), expanded repertoires of signaling pathways, and increased diversity in some transcription factor families.

The fine-scale patterning of lignin deposition in water-conducting cells is shown here to vary phylogenetically across vascular plants. The extent to which water transport in xylem cells can be modified in response to changes in the ionic content of xylem sap also is shown to vary in correlation with variation in lignification patterns, consistent with the proposed mechanism for hydraulic response through size change of middle-lamella pectins. This covariation suggests that the fine-scale distribution of hydrophilic polysaccharides and hydrophobic lignin can affect hydraulic as well as mechanical properties, and that the evolutionary diversification of vascular cells thus reflects biochemical as well as morphological innovations evolved to fulfill opposing cell functions of transport and structural support.;,citation_author=C.

Treatment of the cells with any of three fungal elicitors (wall fragments from Phytophthora megasperma and Pythium aphanidermatum and xylanase from Aureobasidium pullulans) or with 1 mM H2O2 had little effect on the quantity of phenolinextractable hydroxyproline per milligram of freeze-dried cells.

Each treatment, except with the P. megasperma fragments, also induced an increase in phenol-inextractable di- (Di-Idt). The increase in Di-Idt partly accounted for the loss of Idt. We conclude that the elicitors and H2O2 acted to reinforce the existing cross-linking of cell wall (glyco)proteins by evoking oxidative coupling reactions to convert Idt to Di-Idt plus unidentified products.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Arabidopsis thaliana ABSCISIC ACID-INSENSITIVE8 Locus Encodes a Novel Protein Mediating Abscisic Acid and Sugar Responses Essential for Growth[W];,citation_abstract=Abscisic acid (ABA) regulates many aspects of plant growth and development, yet many ABA response mutants present only subtle phenotypic defects, especially in the absence of stress. By contrast, the ABA-insensitive8 (abi8) mutant, isolated on the basis of ABA-resistant germination, also displays severely stunted growth, defective stomatal regulation, altered ABA-responsive gene expression, delayed flowering, and male sterility. The stunted growth of the mutant is not rescued by gibberellin, brassinosteroid, or indoleacetic acid application and is not attributable to excessive ethylene response, but supplementing the medium with Glc improves viability and root growth. In addition to exhibiting Glc-dependent growth, reflecting decreased expression of sugar-mobilizing enzymes, abi8 mutants are resistant to Glc levels that induce developmental arrest of wild-type seedlings. Studies of genetic interactions demonstrate that ABA hypersensitivity conferred by the ABA-hypersensitive1 mutation or overexpression of ABI3 or ABI5 does not suppress the dwarfing and Glc dependence caused by abi8 but partially suppresses ABA-resistant germination. By contrast, the ABA-resistant germination of abi8 is epistatic to the hypersensitivity caused by ethylene-insensitive2 (ein2) and ein3 mutations, yet ABI8 appears to act in a distinct Glc response pathway from these EIN loci. ABI8 encodes a protein with no domains of known function but belongs to a small plant-specific protein family. Database searches indicate that it is allelic to two dwarf mutants, elongation defective1 and kobito1, previously shown to disrupt cell elongation, cellulose synthesis, vascular differentiation, and root meristem maintenance. The cell wall defects appear to be a secondary effect of the mutations because Glc treatment restores root growth and vascular differentiation but not cell elongation. Although the ABI8 transcript accumulates in all tested plant organs in both wild-type and ABA response mutants, an ABI8-\beta-glucuronidase fusion protein is localized primarily to the elongation zone of roots, suggesting substantial post-transcriptional regulation of ABI8 accumulation. This localization pattern is sufficient to complement the mutation, indicating that ABI8 acts either at very low concentrations or over long distances within the plant body.;,citation_author=Inès Brocard-Gifford;,citation_author=Tim J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Water Stress Deforms Tracheids Peripheral to the Leaf Vein of a Tropical Conifer;,citation_abstract=Just as a soggy paper straw is prone to yielding under the applied suction of a thirsty drinker, the xylem tracheids in leaves seem prone to collapse as water potential declines, impeding their function. Here we describe the collapse, under tension, of lignified cells peripheral to the leaf vein of a broad-leaved rainforest conifer, Podocarpus grayi de Laub. Leaves of Podocarpus are characterized by an array of cylindrical tracheids aligned perpendicular to the leaf vein, apparently involved in the distribution of water radially through the mesophyll. During leaf desiccation the majority of these tracheids collapsed from circular to flat over the water potential range -1.5 to -2.8 MPa. An increase in the percentage of tracheids collapsed during imposed water stress was mirrored by declining leaf hydraulic conductivity (Kleaf), implying a direct effect on water transport efficiency. Stomata responded to water stress by closing at -2.0 MPa when 45% of cells were collapsed and Kleaf had declined by 25%. This was still substantially before the initial indications of cavitation-induced loss of hydraulic conductance in the leaf vein, at -3 MPa. Plants droughted until 49% of tracheids had collapsed were found to fully recover tracheid shape and leaf function 1 week after rewatering. A simple mechanical model of tracheid collapse, derived from the theoretical buckling pressure for pipes, accurately predicted the collapse dynamics observed in P. grayi, substantiating estimates of cell wall elasticity and measured leaf water potential.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=GUX1 and GUX2 glucuronyltransferases decorate distinct domains of glucuronoxylan with different substitution patterns;,citation_abstract=Xylan comprises up to one-third of plant cell walls, and it influences the properties and processing of biomass. Glucuronoxylan in Arabidopsis is characterized by a linear \beta-(1,4)-linked backbone of xylosyl residues substituted by glucuronic acid and 4-O-methylglucuronic acid (collectively termed [Me]GlcA). The role of these substitutions remains unclear. GUX1 (glucuronic acid substitution of xylan 1) and GUX2, recently identified as glucuronyltransferases, are both required for substitution of the xylan backbone with [Me]GlcA. Here, we demonstrate clear differences in the pattern of [Me]GlcA substitution generated by each of these glucuronyltransferases. GUX1 decorates xylan with a preference for addition of [Me]GlcA at evenly spaced xylosyl residues. Intervals of eight or 10 residues dominate, but larger intervals are observed. GUX2, in contrast, produces more tightly clustered decorations with most frequent spacing of five, six or seven xylosyl residues, with no preference for odd or even spacing. Moreover, each of these GUX transferases substitutes a distinct domain of secondary cell wall xylan, which we call the major and minor domains. These major and minor xylan domains were not separable from each other by size or charge, a finding that suggests that they are tightly associated. The presence of both differently [Me]GlcA decorated domains may produce a xylan molecule that is heterogeneous in its properties. We speculate that the major and minor domains of xylan may be specialised, such as for interaction with cellulose or lignin. These findings have substantial implications for our understanding of xylan synthesis and structure, and for models of the molecular architecture of the lignocellulosic matrix of plant cell walls.;,citation_author=Jennifer R.

To address this problem, microarray data have been generated from tissue undergoing secondary cell wall formation and used to identify genes that exhibit a similar expression pattern to the secondary cell wall–specific cellulose synthase genes IRREGULAR XYLEM1 (IRX1) and IRX3. Cross-referencing this analysis with publicly available microarray data resulted in the selection of 16 genes for reverse genetic analysis. Lines containing an insertion in seven of these genes exhibited a clear irx phenotype characteristic of a secondary cell wall defect. Only one line, containing an insertion in a member of the COBRA gene family, exhibited a large decrease in cellulose content. Five of the genes identified as being essential for secondary cell wall biosynthesis have not been previously characterized. These genes are likely to define entirely novel processes in secondary cell wall formation and illustrate the success of combining expression data with reverse genetics to address gene function.;,citation_author=David M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Exploring bacterial lignin degradation;,citation_abstract=Plant biomass represents a renewable carbon feedstock that could potentially be used to replace a significant level of petroleum-derived chemicals. One major challenge in its utilization is that the majority of this carbon is trapped in the recalcitrant structural polymers of the plant cell wall. Deconstruction of lignin is a key step in the processing of biomass to useful monomers but remains challenging. Microbial systems can provide molecular information on lignin depolymerization as they have evolved to break lignin down using metalloenzyme-dependent radical pathways. Both fungi and bacteria have been observed to metabolize lignin; however, their differential reactivity with this substrate indicates that they may utilize different chemical strategies for its breakdown. This review will discuss recent advances in studying bacterial lignin degradation as an approach to exploring greater diversity in the environment. ?? 2013.;,citation_author=Margaret E.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=How tree roots respond to drought;,citation_abstract=The ongoing climate change is characterised by increased temperatures and altered precipitation patterns. In addition, there has been an increase in both the frequency and intensity of extreme climatic events such as drought. Episodes of drought induce a series of interconnected effects, all of which have the potential to alter the carbon balance of forest ecosystems profoundly at different scales of plant organisation and ecosystem functioning. During recent years, considerable progress has been made in the understanding of how aboveground parts of trees respond to drought and how these responses affect carbon assimilation. In contrast, processes of belowground parts are relatively underrepresented in research on climate change. In this review, we describe current knowledge about responses of tree roots to drought. Tree roots are capable of responding to drought through a variety of strategies that enable them to avoid and tolerate stress. Responses include root biomass adjustments, anatomical alterations, and physiological acclimations. The molecular mechanisms underlying these responses are characterized to some extent, and involve stress signalling and the induction of numerous genes, leading to the activation of tolerance pathways. In addition, mycorrhizas seem to play important protective roles. The current knowledge compiled in this review supports the view that tree roots are well equipped to withstand drought situations and maintain morphological and physiological functions as long as possible. Further, the reviewed literature demonstrates the important role of tree roots in the functioning of forest ecosystems and highlights the need for more research in this emerging field.;,citation_author=Ivano Brunner;,citation_author=Claude Herzog;,citation_author=Melissa A.

Only a hand-full of laccases in plants have been functionally evaluated and as such little is known about the breadth of their impact on cell wall chemistry or structure. Here we describe a previously uncharacterized laccase from Populus, encoded by locus Potri.008G064000, whose reduced expression resulted in transgenic Populus trees with changes in syringyl/guaiacyl (S/G) ratios as well as altered sugar release phenotypes. These phenotypes are consistent with plant biomass exhibiting reduced recalcitrance. Interestingly, the transgene effect on recalcitrance is dependent on a mild pretreatment prior to chemical extraction of sugars. Metabolite profiling suggests the transgene modulates phenolics that are associated with the cell wall structure. We propose that this particular laccase has a range of functions related to oxidation of phenolics and conjugation of flavonoids that interact with lignin in the cell wall.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Co-evolution of Enzymes Involved in Plant Cell Wall Metabolism in the Grasses;,citation_abstract=There has been a dramatic evolutionary shift in the polysaccharide composition of cell walls in the grasses, with increases in arabinoxylans and (1,3;1,4)-\beta-glucans and decreases in pectic polysaccharides, mannans, and xyloglucans, compared with other angiosperms. Several enzymes are involved in the biosynthesis of arabinoxylans, but the overall process is not yet defined and whether their increased abundance in grasses results from active or reactive evolutionary forces is not clear. Phylogenetic analyses reveal that multiple independent evolution of genes encoding (1,3;1,4)-\beta-glucan synthases has probably occurred within the large cellulose synthase/cellulose synthase-like (CesA/Csl) gene family of angiosperms. The (1,3;1,4)-\beta-glucan synthases appear to be capable of inserting both (1,3)- and (1,4)-\beta-linkages in the elongating polysaccharide chain, although the precise mechanism through which this is achieved remains unclear. Nevertheless, these enzymes probably evolved from synthases that originally synthesized only (1,4)-\beta-linkages. Initially, (1,3;1,4)-\beta-glucans could be turned over through preexisting cellulases, but as the need for specific hydrolysis was required, the grasses evolved specific (1,3;1,4)-\beta-glucan endohydrolases. The corresponding genes evolved from genes for the more widely distributed (1,3)-\beta-glucan endohydrolases. Why the subgroups of CesA/Csl genes that mediate the synthesis of (1,3;1,4)-\beta-glucans have been retained by the highly successful grasses but by few other angiosperms or lower plants represents an intriguing biological question.

Directed evolution improved expression eightfold to the highest yet reported for a laccase in yeast (18 mg/liter). Together with a 22-fold increase in k(cat), the total activity was enhanced 170-fold. Specific activities of MtL mutants toward 2,2’-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) and syringaldazine indicate that substrate specificity was not changed by the introduced mutations. The most effective mutation (10-fold increase in total activity) introduced a Kex2 protease recognition site at the C-terminal processing site of the protein, adjusting the protein sequence to the different protease specificities of the heterologous host. The C terminus is shown to be important for laccase activity, since removing it by a truncation of the gene reduces activity sixfold. Mutations accumulated during nine generations of evolution for higher activity decreased enzyme stability. Screening for improved stability in one generation produced a mutant more stable than the heterologous wild type and retaining the improved activity. The molecular mass of MtL expressed in S. cerevisiae is 30% higher than that of the same enzyme expressed in M. thermophila (110 kDa versus 85 kDa).

Mechanical properties of wood are dependent on cellulose microfibril alignment and structure in the cell walls, but the molecular mechanism(s) defining these features is unknown. Herein, we investigated the role of CSI1 in hybrid aspen (Populus tremula  Populus tremuloides) by characterizing transgenic lines with significantly reduced CSI1 transcript abundance. Reduction in leaves (50–80%) caused leaf twisting and misshaped pavement cells, while reduction (70–90%) in developing xylem led to impaired mechanical wood properties evident as a decrease in the elastic modulus and rupture. X-ray diffraction measurements indicate that microfibril angle was not impacted by the altered CSI1 abundance in developing wood fibres. Instead, the augmented wood phenotype of the transgenic trees was associated with a reduced cellulose degree of polymerization. These findings establish a function for CSI1 in wood mechanics and in defining leaf cell shape.

Several viral vectors have been developed for VIGS and they have been successfully used in reverse genetics studies of a variety of processes occurring in plants. This approach has not been widely adopted for the model dicotyledonous species Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), possibly because, until now, there has been no easy protocol for effective VIGS in this species. Here, we show that a widely used tobacco rattle virus-based VIGS vector can be used for silencing genes in Arabidopsis ecotype Columbia-0. The protocol involves agroinfiltration of VIGS vectors carrying fragments of genes of interest into seedlings at the two- to three-leaf stage and requires minimal modification of existing protocols for VIGS with tobacco rattle virus vectors in other species like Nicotiana benthamiana and tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A Katanin-like Protein Regulates Normal Cell Wall Biosynthesis and Cell Elongation;,citation_abstract=Fibers are one of the mechanical tissues that provide structural support to the plant body. To understand how the nor- mal mechanical strength of fibers is regulated, we isolated an Arabidopsis fragile fiber ( fra2 ) mutant defective in the mechanical strength of interfascicular fibers in the inflorescence stems. Anatomical and chemical analyses showed that the fra2 mutation caused a reduction in fiber cell length and wall thickness, a decrease in cellulose and hemicellu- lose contents, and an increase in lignin condensation, indicating that the fragile fiber phenotype of fra2 is a result of al- terations in fiber cell elongation and cell wall biosynthesis. In addition to the effects on fibers, the fra2 mutation resulted in a remarkable reduction in cell length and an increase in cell width in all organs, which led to a global alter- ation in plant morphology. The FRA2 gene was shown to encode a protein with high similarity to katanin (hence FRA2 was renamed AtKTN1 ), a protein shown to be involved in regulating microtubule disassembly by severing microtu- bules. Consistent with the putative function of AtKTN1 as a microtubule-severing protein, immunolocalization demon- strated that the fra2 mutation caused delays in the disappearance of perinuclear microtubule array and in the establishment of transverse cortical microtubule array in interphase and elongating cells. Together, these results sug- gest that AtKTN1, a katanin-like protein, is essential not only for normal cell wall biosynthesis and cell elongation in fi- ber cells but also for cell expansion in all organs.;,citation_author=David H.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Alteration of Oriented Deposition of Cellulose Microfibrils by Mutation of a Katanin-Like Microtubule-Severing Protein;,citation_abstract=It has long been hypothesized that cortical microtubules (MTs) control the orientation of cellulose microfibril deposition, but no mutants with alterations of MT orientation have been shown to affect this process. We have shown previously that in Arabidopsis, the fra2 mutation causes aberrant cortical MT orientation and reduced cell elongation, and the gene responsible for the fra2 mutation encodes a katanin-like protein. In this study, using field emission scanning electron microscopy, we found that the fra2 mutation altered the normal orientation of cellulose microfibrils in walls of expanding cells. Although cellulose microfibrils in walls of wild-type cells were oriented transversely along the elongation axis, cellulose microfibrils in walls of fra2 cells often formed bands and ran in different directions. The fra2 mutation also caused aberrant deposition of cellulose microfibrils in secondary walls of fiber cells. The aberrant orientation of cellulose microfibrils was shown to be correlated with disorganized cortical MTs in several cell types examined. In addition, the thickness of both primary and secondary cell walls was reduced significantly in the fra2 mutant. These results indicate that the katanin-like protein is essential for oriented cellulose microfibril deposition and normal cell wall biosynthesis. We further demonstrated that the Arabidopsis katanin-like protein possessed MT-severing activity in vitro; thus, it is an ortholog of animal katanin. We propose that the aberrant MT orientation caused by the mutation of katanin results in the distorted deposition of cellulose microfibrils, which in turn leads to a defect in cell elongation. These findings strongly support the hypothesis that cortical MTs regulate the oriented deposition of cellulose microfibrils that determines the direction of cell elongation.;,citation_author=D. H.

The mode of binding of bestatin to leucine aminopeptidase may be similar to that of a tetrahedral intermediate that is thought to form during peptide bond hydrolysis. Bestatin binds in the active site with its a-amino group and hydroxyl group coordinated to the zinc ion located in the readily exchangeable divalent cation binding site. Its phenylalanyl side chain is stabilized by van der Waals interactions with Met-270, Thr-359, Gly-362, Aa-451, and Met-454, which appear to form a terminal hydrophobic pocket. The leucyl side chain binds in another hydrophobic cleft lined by Asn-330, Ala-333, and fle-421.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Microtubule Dynamics in Plant Cells;,citation_abstract=This chapter describes some of the choices and unavoidable compromises to be made when studying microtubule dynamics in plant cells. The choice of species still depends very much on the ability to produce transgenic plants and most work has been done in the relatively small cells of Arabidopsis plants or in tobacco BY-2 suspension cells. Fluorescence-tagged microtubule proteins have been used to label entire microtubules, or their plus ends, but there are still few minus-end markers for these acentrosomal cells. Pragmatic decisions have to be made about probes, balancing the efficacy of microtubule labeling against a tendency to overstabilize and bundle the microtubules and even induce helical plant growth. A key limitation in visualizing plant microtubules is the ability to keep plants alive for long periods under the microscope and we describe a biochamber that allows for plant cell growth and development while allowing gas exchange and reducing evaporation. Another major difficulty is the limited fluorescence lifetime and we describe imaging strategies to reduce photobleaching in long-term imaging. We also discuss methods of measuring microtubule dynamics, with emphasis on the behavior of plant-specific microtubule arrays. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.;,citation_author=Henrik Buschmann;,citation_author=Adrian Sambade;,citation_author=Edouard Pesquet;,citation_author=Grant Calder;,citation_author=Clive W.

Here, we focus on the effects of salt stress on cell wall modifying enzymes, cellulose microfibril orientation and non-cellulosic polysaccharide deposition in root elongation zones, as important determinants of inhibition of root elongation, and highlight cell wall changes linked to tolerance to salt stressed and water limited roots. Salt stress induces changes in the wall composition of specific root cell types, including the increased deposition of lignin and suberin in endodermal and exodermal cells. These changes can benefit the plant by preventing water loss and altering ion transport pathways. We suggest that binding of Na+ions to cell wall components might influence the passage of Na+and that Na+can influence the binding of other ions and hinder the function of pectin during cell growth.

In this study, a major leucyl aminopeptidolytic activity was identified in Trypanosoma cruzi, the aetiological agent of Chagas disease.\n\nRESULTS: The enzyme was isolated from epimastigote forms of the parasite by a two-step chromatographic procedure and associated with a single 330-kDa homohexameric protein as determined by sedimentation velocity and light scattering experiments. Peptide mass fingerprinting identified the enzyme as the predicted T. cruzi aminopeptidase EAN97960. Molecular and enzymatic analysis indicated that this leucyl aminopeptidase of T. cruzi (LAPTc) belongs to the peptidase family M17 or leucyl aminopeptidase family. LAPTc has a strong dependence on neutral pH, is mesophilic and retains its oligomeric form up to 80^\circC. Conversely, its recombinant form is thermophilic and requires alkaline pH.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: LAPTc is a 330-kDa homohexameric metalloaminopeptidase expressed by all T. cruzi forms and mediates the major parasite leucyl aminopeptidolytic activity. Since biosynthetic pathways for essential amino acids, including leucine, are lacking in T. cruzi, LAPTc could have a function in nutritional supply.;,citation_author=Gloria Cadavid-Restrepo;,citation_author=Thiago S Gastardelo;,citation_author=Eric Faudry;,citation_author=Hugo Almeida;,citation_author=Izabela Md Bastos;,citation_author=Raquel S Negreiros;,citation_author=Meire M Lima;,citation_author=Teresa C Assumpção;,citation_author=Keyla C Almeida;,citation_author=Michel Ragno;,citation_author=Christine Ebel;,citation_author=Bergmann M Ribeiro;,citation_author=Carlos R Felix;,citation_author=Jaime M Santana;,citation_publication_date=2011;,citation_cover_date=2011;,citation_year=2011;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1186/1471-2091-12-46;,citation_issn=1471-2091;,citation_pmid=21861921;,citation_volume=12;,citation_journal_title=BMC Biochem.;">

However, the predicted hydraulic conductances per unit length (Kh) are generally much higher than measured values and important anatomical details, such as the pits of tracheids, are ignored. Here, a previous model based on the Hagen-Poiseuille analysis for water flow in the stipes of Pteris vittata is improved by incorporating the actual lumen transectional shape (usually elliptical or ovate) and the tapering that occurs at the ends of its tracheids, as well as using a better method for analysing the electrical circuit analogues for the pits (pit cavities plus pit membranes). The measured Kh was similar to that predicted by the Hagen-Poiseuille equation for narrow stipes with their small tracheids, but was only about half the measured Kh for large stipes. Correcting for the actual shape changed Kh 2- to 3-fold for tracheids with elliptic and ovate transections. For the smaller diameter tracheids, most of the flow resistance was from the lumens but for the larger tracheids most was from the pit membranes.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Cloning and characterization of a new laccase from Lactobacillus plantarum J16 CECT 8944 catalyzing biogenic amines degradation;,citation_abstract=In our search for degrading activities of biogenic amines (BAs) in lactic acid bacteria, a protein annotated as laccase enzyme was identified in Lactobacillus plantarum J16 (CECT 8944). In this study, the gene of this new laccase was cloned and heterologously overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant laccase protein was purified and characterized biochemically. The purified laccase showed characteristic spectroscopic properties of blue multicopper oxidases. The enzyme has a molecular weight of \sim62.5 kDa and activity toward typical laccase substrates 2,2’-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) and 2,6-dimethoxyphenol (2,6-DMP). The pH optima on ABTS and 2,6-DMP were 3.5 and 7.0, respectively. Kinetic constants K m and V max were of 0.21 mM and 0.54 U/mg for ABTS and 1.67 mM and 0.095 U/mg for 2,6-DMP, respectively. The highest oxidizing activity toward 2,6-DMP was obtained at 60 ^\circC. However, after a preincubation step at 85 ^\circC for 10 min, no residual activity was detected. It has been demonstrated that recombinant L. plantarum laccase oxidizes biogenic amines, mainly tyramine, and thus presents new biotechnological potential for the enzyme in eliminating toxic compounds present in fermented food and beverages.;,citation_author=S.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Contrasting nitrogen fertilization treatments impact xylem gene expression and secondary cell wall lignification in Eucalyptus;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Nitrogen (N) is a main nutrient required for tree growth and biomass accumulation. In this study, we analyzed the effects of contrasting nitrogen fertilization treatments on the phenotypes of fast growing Eucalyptus hybrids (E. urophylla x E. grandis) with a special focus on xylem secondary cell walls and global gene expression patterns.\n\nRESULTS: Histological observations of the xylem secondary cell walls further confirmed by chemical analyses showed that lignin was reduced by luxuriant fertilization, whereas a consistent lignin deposition was observed in trees grown in N-limiting conditions. Also, the syringyl/guaiacyl (S/G) ratio was significantly lower in luxuriant nitrogen samples. Deep sequencing RNAseq analyses allowed us to identify a high number of differentially expressed genes (1,469) between contrasting N treatments. This number is dramatically higher than those obtained in similar studies performed in poplar but using microarrays. Remarkably, all the genes involved the general phenylpropanoid metabolism and lignin pathway were found to be down-regulated in response to high N availability. These findings further confirmed by RT-qPCR are in agreement with the reduced amount of lignin in xylem secondary cell walls of these plants.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: This work enabled us to identify, at the whole genome level, xylem genes differentially regulated by N availability, some of which are involved in the environmental control of xylogenesis. It further illustrates that N fertilization can be used to alter the quantity and quality of lignocellulosic biomass in Eucalyptus, offering exciting prospects for the pulp and paper industry and for the use of short coppices plantations to produce second generation biofuels.;,citation_author=Eduardo Leal Oliveira Camargo;,citation_author=Leandro Costa Nascimento;,citation_author=Marçal Soler;,citation_author=Marcela Mendes Salazar;,citation_author=Jorge Lepikson-Neto;,citation_author=Wesley Leoricy Marques;,citation_author=Ana Alves;,citation_author=Paulo José Pereira Lima Teixeira;,citation_author=Piotr Mieczkowski;,citation_author=Marcelo Falsarella Carazzolle;,citation_author=Yves Martinez;,citation_author=Ana Carolina Deckmann;,citation_author=José Carlos Rodrigues;,citation_author=Jacqueline Grima-Pettenati;,citation_author=Gonçalo Amarante Guimarães Pereira;,citation_publication_date=2014-12;,citation_cover_date=2014-12;,citation_year=2014;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1186/s12870-014-0256-9;,citation_isbn=1471-2229 (Electronic){\textbackslash}r1471-2229 (Linking);,citation_issn=1471-2229;,citation_pmid=25260963;,citation_volume=14;,citation_journal_title=BMC Plant Biol.;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Fungal elicitor-mediated responses in pine cell cultures - I. Induction of phenylpropanoid metabolism;,citation_abstract=Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL, EC 4.3.1.5) is involved in the lignification of pine suspension cultures in response to an elicitor prepared from an ectomycorrhizal fungus. To elucidate the molecular basis of this response, PAL was purified to homogeneity from jack pine (Pinus banksiana) suspension cultures using anion-exchange and chromatofocussing fast protein liquid chromatography. Physical characterization of the enzyme revealed that pine PAL was similar to PAL from other plant sources. Pine PAL had a pH optimum of 8.8, an isoelectric point of 5.75, and a native molecular mass of 340 kilodaltons. The enzyme appears to be a tetramer composed of 77 kilodalton subunits. Chromatographic and western blot analyses were used to identify possible isoenzymic changes in pine PAL in response to elicitation and to determine the nature of the increase in PAL activity associated with inducible lignification in these cultures. Only one species of PAL was detected in P. banksiana cell cultures and increased quantities of this protein were correlated with the enhanced enzyme activity observed in elicited cultures. P. banksiana PAL was not feedback-inhibited by a wide range of phenolic compounds at micromolar concentrations, including the reaction product cinnamic acid. Our data suggest that a different set of metabolic and molecular controls must be in place for the regulation of PAL in pine. Images: Figure 2: Figure 3: Figure 5:;,citation_author=Malcolm M.

The effect of these natural mediators, namely vanillin, acetovanillone, acetosyringone, syringaldehyde, 2,4,6-trimethylphenol, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, and sinapic acid, was compared with that of synthetic mediators such as 2,2’-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) (ABTS) and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HBT). Anthracene was significantly degraded by laccase in the absence of mediators, whereas benzo[a]pyrene and pyrene were weakly transformed (less than 15% after 24 h). Vanillin, acetovanillone, 2,4,6-trimethylphenol, and, above all, p-coumaric acid strongly promoted the removal of PAHs by laccase. 9,10-Anthraquinone was the main product detected from anthracene oxidation by all the laccase-mediator systems. The yield of anthraquinone formed was directly correlated with the amount of p-coumaric acid used. This compound resulted in a better laccase mediator than ABTS and close similarity to HBT, attaining 95% removal of anthracene and benzo[a]pyrene and around 50% of pyrene within 24 h. Benzo[a]pyrene 1,6-, 3,6-, and 6,12-quinones were produced during benzo[a]pyrene oxidation with laccase and p-coumaric acid, HBT, or ABTS as mediators, although use of the latter mediator gave further oxidation products that were not produced by the two other systems.;,citation_author=Ana I.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Laccases and their natural mediators: Biotechnological tools for sustainable eco-friendly processes;,citation_abstract=Laccases are oxidoreductases which oxidize a variety of aromatic compounds using oxygen as the electron acceptor and producing water as by-product.

The presence of redox mediators is required for a number of biotechnological applications, providing the oxidation of complex substrates not oxidized by the enzyme alone. The efficiency of laccase-mediator systems to degrade recalcitrant compounds has been demonstrated, but still the high cost and possible toxicity of artificial mediators hamper their application at the industrial scale. Here, we present a general outlook of how alternative mediators can change this tendency. We focus on phenolic compounds related to lignin polymer that promotes the in vitro transformation of recalcitrant non-phenolic structures by laccase and are seemingly the natural mediators of laccases.

The main modifications, as compared to Neuhoff’s protocol, were: a 20% increment in dye concentration (from 0.1% up to 0.12%) and a much higher level of phosphoric acid in the recipe (from 2% up to 10%). The &quot;blue silver&quot; exhibits a much faster dye uptake (80% during the first hour of coloration, vs. none with a commercial preparation from Sigma). Even at equilibrium (24 h staining), the &quot;blue silver&quot; exhibits a much higher sensitivity than all other recipes, approaching (but lower than) the one of the classical silver stain. Measurements of stain sensitivity after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of bovine serum albumin (BSA) gave a detection limit (signal-to-noise ratio &amp;gt; 3) of 1 ng in a single zone. The somewhat lower sensitivity of &quot;blue silver&quot; as compared to classical silvering protocols in the presence of aldehydes is amply compensated for by its full compatibility with mass spectrometry of eluted polypeptide chains, after a two-dimensional map analysis, thus confirming that no dye is covalently bound (or permanently modifies) to any residue in the proteinaceous material. It is believed that the higher level of phosphoric acid in the recipe, thus its lower final pH, helps in protonating the last dissociated residues of Asp and Glu in the polypeptide coils, thus greatly favoring ionic anchoring of dye molecules to the protein moiety. Such a binding, though, must be followed by considerable hydrophobic association with the aromatic and hydrophobic residues along the polypeptide backbone.;,citation_author=Giovanni Candiano;,citation_author=Maurizio Bruschi;,citation_author=Luca Musante;,citation_author=Laura Santucci;,citation_author=Gian Marco Ghiggeri;,citation_author=Barbara Carnemolla;,citation_author=Paola Orecchia;,citation_author=Luciano Zardi;,citation_author=Pier Giorgio Righetti;,citation_publication_date=2004;,citation_cover_date=2004;,citation_year=2004;,citation_issue=9;,citation_doi=10.1002/elps.200305844;,citation_isbn=3945802792;,citation_issn=01730835;,citation_pmid=15174055;,citation_volume=25;,citation_journal_title=Electrophoresis;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Tyloses and the Maintenance of Transpiration;,citation_abstract=During a study of transpiration and embolism-formation in petioles of sunflower, tyloses were frequently observed in early metaxylem vessels. Tyloses were confined to the inner ends of the xylem arcs, remote from the phloem. Vessels in this position are especially vulnerable to embolism. All stages of the invasion of vessel lumens by xylem parenchyma cells were observed, from the early protuberance of a cell through a pit to the complete occlusion of the lumen by one to several cells. The lumen space not occupied by tyloses was seen both filled with xylem sap, or embolized and gas-filled. Thus, during the early stages of tylosis formation the vessel remained active in carrying the transpiration stream. Thin-walled vessels of the protoxylem or early metaxylem were not tylosed, but were squashed and disappeared. These observations are interpreted as evidence that vessels vulnerable to embolism are decommissioned and replaced by parenchyma tissue, while new and less vulnerable vessels are added to the xylem arcs at the cambial side. It is proposed that tylosis formation is triggered by the frequent embolization of the vulnerable vessels to give, ultimately, an incompressible tissue. Then tyloses would be necessary to preserve the tissue pressure which expresses water to refill embolisms in the remaining vessels, and maintain transpiration, as explained by the compensating pressure theory of water transport.;,citation_author=M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Isolation and characterisation of a family of laccases in maize;,citation_abstract=Plant laccases are enzymes that have been proposed to participate in the last step of lignin biosynthesis. The polymerisation event remains still much unknown, implicating other enzymes such as peroxidases. To gain more insight in how this polymerisation process takes place in maize, we isolated by differential screening of an elongation maize root cDNA library four cDNA clones encoding a family of laccases. Three of them (ZmLac2, ZmLac4, ZmLac5) were basic enzymes, while one of them (ZmLac3) was an acidic enzyme. Southern analysis indicates that laccases belong to a multigene family in maize. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that ZmLac2, ZmLac4, and ZmLac5 are closely related enzymes, whereas ZmLac3 is a slightly different enzyme. The pattern of mRNA accumulation of ZmLac2, ZmLac3, ZmLac4, and ZmLac5 genes correlates with the maize regions undergoing lignification. Moreover, ZmLac3 is induced by wounding, whereas ZmLac2 and ZmLac5 are repressed and ZmLac4 gene expression is not affected. Taken together, our results suggest that the acidic ZmLac3 enzyme could be involved in the polymerisation of phenolic compounds in maize. Instead, and in agreement with the idea that laccases are enzymes involved in a wide range of physiological processes, results obtained with ZmLac2, ZmLac4, and ZmLac5 lead us to exclude a direct role of these laccases in lignin polymerisation. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Plants and animals, after their water emersion, have developed biochemical mechanisms to protect themselves from that environmental threat through a common strategy. Melanins in animals and flavonoids in plants are antioxidant pigments acting as free radical scavenging mechanisms. Both are phenol compounds constitutively synthesized and enhanced after exposure to UV rays, often conferring a red-brown-dark tissue pigmentation. Noteworthy, beside anti-oxidant scavenging activity, melanins and flavonoids have acquired secondary functions that, both in plants and animals, concern reproductions and fitness. Plants highly pigmented are more resistant to biotic and abiotic stresses. Darker wild vertebrates are generally more aggressive, sexually active and resistant to stress than lighter individuals. Flavonoids have been associated with signal attraction between flowers and insects and with plant-plant interaction. Melanin pigmentation has been proposed as trait in bird communication, acting as honest signals of quality.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Wood, Bark, and Stem Anatomy of Gnetales: A Summary;,citation_abstract=Data from a series of eight papers, representing a survey of Gnetales at the species level, are summarized in order to develop concepts on the relationship between the anatomical data and ecology, phylogeny, and systematics. Most of the characters and character states newly reported have phylogenetic and ecological correlations for Gnetales as a whole rather than systematic significance within the genera. Wood features are sensitively related to habit, although strategies in lianoid species of Ephedra differ from those in lianoid Gnetum species. Data also bear close relationships to organography. Vessel details are given special attention because workers have questioned whether vessels originated in Gnetales independently of those in angiosperms, and thus whether or not vessel origin in the two groups is a synapomorphy. The evidence cited here favors origin of vessels in Gnetales independent of vessel origins in angiosperms Hitherto unappreciated contrasts between vessels of Gnetales and those of angiosperms are detailed: the torusmargo structure of pits in Gnetales (both Ephedra and Gnetum), and the aspiration ability of gnetalean pits represent modes of conduction and promotion of conductive safety different from those in angiosperms, and the shape difference (circular vs scalariform), cited in data matrices of cladograms, is secondary to the different functional syndromes. The intercalation of circular bordered pits into helical secondary wall thickenings of primary xylem tracheary elements of Ephedra and Gnetum (a feature found also in conifers and Ginkgo but not in angiosperms) is given new functional interpretations. Ephedra and Gnetum contain both tracheids and fiber-tracheids that co-occur in a mode different from that in angiosperms which contain both cell types together. Ray structure like that of Gnetales occurs widely within seed plants and likely offers little conclusive information about relationships. Wood data on Gnetales are compatible with the hypothesis that a vesselless group of gymnosperms, such as Pentoxylales or Bennettitales, is the closest sister group of angiosperms. Formation of successive cambia in Gnetum differs from that in Welwitschia: the latter has phellem but no other bark. Because Welwitschia has only phellem, there are more numerous bark features in common between Ephedra and Gnetum than one might have expected.

A wealth of experimental data has demonstrated the complicated genetic interactions required to form the large synthetic complex that synthesizes cellulose. However, these results are lacking an extensive analysis of the evolution, specialization, and regulation of the proteins that compose this complex. Here we perform an in-depth analysis of the sequences in the cellulose synthase (CesA) family. We investigate the phylogeny of the CesA family, with emphasis on evolutionary specialization. We define specialized clades and identify the class-specific regions within the CesA sequence that may explain this specialization. We investigate changes in regulation of CesAs by looking at the conservation of proposed phosphorylation sites. We investigate the conservation of sites where mutations have been documented that impair CesA function, and compare these sites to those observed in the closest cellulose synthase-like (Csl) families to better understand what regions may separate the CesAs from other Csls. Finally we identify two positions with strong conservation of the aromatic trait, but lacking conservation of amino acid identity, which may represent residues important for positioning the sugar substrate for catalysis. These analyses provide useful tools for understanding characterized mutations and post-translational modifications, and for informing further experiments to probe CesA assembly, regulation, and function through site-directed mutagenesis or domain swapping experiments.;,citation_author=Andrew Carroll;,citation_author=Chelsea Specht;,citation_publication_date=2011;,citation_cover_date=2011;,citation_year=2011;,citation_issn=1664-462X;,citation_volume=2;,citation_journal_title=Front.

Recently, we identified the first example of an intracellular protease (leucine aminopeptidase, LAP) that is required for virulence in S. aureus. Disruption of pepZ, the gene encoding LAP, had no affect on the growth rate of bacteria; however, in systemic and localized infection models the pepZ mutant had significantly attenuated virulence. Recently, a contradictory report was published suggesting that LAP is an extracellular enzyme and it is required for growth in S. aureus. Here, we investigate these results and confirm our previous findings that LAP is localized to the bacterial cytosol and is not required for growth. In addition, we conduct a biochemical investigation of purified recombinant LAP, identifying optimal conditions for enzymatic activity and substrate preference for hydrolysis. Our results show that LAP has a broad substrate range, including activity against the dipeptide cysteine-glycine, and that leucine is not the primary target of LAP.;,citation_author=Ronan K.

The majority of cell wall proteins are cross-linked into the wall and probably have structural functions, although they may also participate in morphogenesis. On the other hand, arabinogalactan proteins are readily soluble and possibly play a major role in cell-cell interactions during development.

The glycan moiety of extensins is believed to confer the correct structural conformation to the glycoprotein, leading to self-assembly within the cell wall that helps limit microbial adherence and invasion. However, this role is not clearly established.We used Arabidopsis thaliana mutants impaired in extensin arabinosylation to investigate the role of extensin arabinosylation in root–microbe interactions. Mutant and wild-type roots were stimulated to elicit an immune response with flagellin 22 and immunolabelled with a set of anti-extensin antibodies. Roots were also inoculated with a soilborne oomycete, Phytophthora parasitica, to assess the effect of extensin arabinosylation on root colonization.A differential distribution of extensin epitopes was observed in wild-type plants in response to elicitation. Elicitation also triggers altered epitope expression in mutant roots compared with wild-type and non-elicited roots. Inoculation with the pathogen P. parasitica resulted in enhanced root colonization for two mutants, specifically xeg113 and rra2.We provide evidence for a link between extensin arabinosylation and root defence, and propose a model to explain the importance of glycosylation in limiting invasion of root cells by pathogenic oomycetes.;,citation_author=Romain Castilleux;,citation_author=Barbara Plancot;,citation_author=Bruno Gügi;,citation_author=Agnès Attard;,citation_author=Corinne Loutelier-Bourhis;,citation_author=Benjamin Lefranc;,citation_author=Eric Nguema-Ona;,citation_author=Mustapha Arkoun;,citation_author=Jean-Claude Yvin;,citation_author=Azeddine Driouich;,citation_author=Maïté Vicré;,citation_publication_date=2020-04;,citation_cover_date=2020-04;,citation_year=2020;,citation_issue=5;,citation_doi=10.1093/aob/mcz068;,citation_issn=0305-7364;,citation_volume=125;,citation_journal_title=Ann.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Poplar trees for phytoremediation of high levels of nitrate and applications in bioenergy;,citation_abstract=Summary: The utilization of high amounts of nitrate fertilizers for crop yield leads to nitrate pollution of ground and surface waters. In this study, we report the assimilation and utilization of nitrate luxuriant levels, 20 times more than the highest N fertilizer application in Europe, by transgenic poplars overexpressing a cytosolic glutamine synthetase (GS1). In comparison with the wild-type controls, transgenic plants grown under high N levels exhibited increased biomass (171.6%) and accumulated higher levels of proteins, chlorophylls and total sugars such as glucose, fructose and sucrose. These plants also exhibited greater nitrogen-use efficiency particularly in young leaves, suggesting that they are able to translocate most of the resources to the above-ground part of the plant to produce biomass. The transgenic poplar transcriptome was greatly affected in response to N availability with 1237 genes differentially regulated in high N, while only 632 genes were differentially expressed in untransformed plants. Many of these genes are essential in the adaptation and response against N excess and include those involved in photosynthesis, cell wall formation and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. Cellulose production in the transgenic plants was fivefold higher than in control plants, indicating that transgenic poplars represent a potential feedstock for applications in bioenergy. In conclusion, our results show that GS transgenic poplars can be used not only for improving growth and biomass production but also as an important resource for potential phytoremediation of nitrate pollution. © 2015 Society for Experimental Biology, Association of Applied Biologists and John Wiley &amp;amp;amp; Sons Ltd.;,citation_author=Vanessa Castro-Rodríguez;,citation_author=Angel García-Gutiérrez;,citation_author=Javier Canales;,citation_author=Rafael A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Auxin controls arabidopsis anther dehiscence by regulating endothecium lignification and jasmonic acid biosynthesis;,citation_abstract=It has been suggested that, in Arabidopsis, auxin controls the timing of anther dehiscence, possibly by preventing premature endothecium lignification. We show here that auxin content in anthers peaks before the beginning of dehiscence and decreases when endothecium lignification occurs. We show that, in the auxin-perception mutants afb1-3 and tir1 afb2 afb3, endothecium lignification and anther dehiscence occur earlier than wild-type, and the gene encoding the transcription factor MYB26, which is required for endothecium lignification, is over-expressed specifically at early stages; in agreement, MYB26 expression is reduced in naphthalene acetic acid-treated anthers, and afb1 myb26 double mutants show no endothecial lignification, suggesting that auxin acts through MYB26. As jasmonic acid (JA) controls anther dehiscence, we analysed how auxin and JA interact. In the JA-defective opr3 mutant, indehiscent anthers show normal timing of endothecium lignification, suggesting that JA does not control this event. We show that expression of the OPR3 and DAD1 JA biosynthetic genes is enhanced in afb1-3 and tir1 afb2 afb3 flower buds, but is reduced in naphthalene acetic acid-treated flower buds, suggesting that auxin negatively regulates JA biosynthesis. The double mutant afb1 opr3 shows premature endothecium lignification, as in afb1-3, and indehiscent anthers due to lack of JA, which is required for stomium opening. By treating afb1 opr3 and opr3 inflorescences with JA, we show that a high JA content and precocious endothecium lignification both contribute to induction of early anther dehiscence. We propose that auxin controls anther dehiscence timing by negatively regulating two key events: endothecium lignification via MYB26, and stomium opening via the control of JA biosynthesis.;,citation_author=Valentina Cecchetti;,citation_author=Maria Maddalena Altamura;,citation_author=Patrizia Brunetti;,citation_author=Valentina Petrocelli;,citation_author=Giuseppina Falasca;,citation_author=Karin Ljung;,citation_author=Paolo Costantino;,citation_author=Maura Cardarelli;,citation_publication_date=2013;,citation_cover_date=2013;,citation_year=2013;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1111/tpj.12130;,citation_isbn=1365-313X;,citation_issn=09607412;,citation_pmid=23410518;,citation_volume=74;,citation_journal_title=Plant J.;">

Although essential for plant growth and development, lignin is the major plant cell-wall component responsible for biomass recalcitrance to industrial processing. Peroxidases and laccases are generally thought to be responsible for lignin polymerization, but, given their broad substrate specificities and large gene families, specific isoforms involved in lignification are difficult to identify. This study used a combination of co-expression analysis, tissue/cell-type-specific expression analysis, and genetic complementation to correlate a sugarcane laccase gene, SofLAC, to the lignification process. A co-expression network constructed from 37 cDNA libraries showed that SofLAC was coordinately expressed with several phenylpropanoid biosynthesis genes. Tissue-specific expression analysis by quantitative RT-PCR showed that SofLAC was expressed preferentially in young internodes and that expression levels decrease with stem maturity. Cell-type-specific expression analysis by in situ hybridization demonstrated the localization of SofLAC mRNA in lignifying cell types, mainly in inner and outer portions of sclerenchymatic bundle sheaths. To investigate whether SofLAC is able to oxidize monolignols during lignification, the Arabidopsis lac17 mutant, which has reduced lignin levels, was complemented by expressing SofLAC under the control of the Arabidopsis AtLAC17 promoter. The expression of SofLAC restored the lignin content but not the lignin composition in complemented lac17 mutant lines. Taken together, these results suggest that SofLAC participates in lignification in sugarcane.;,citation_author=Igor Cesarino;,citation_author=Pedro Araújo;,citation_author=Juliana Lischka Sampaio Mayer;,citation_author=Renato Vicentini;,citation_author=Serge Berthet;,citation_author=Brecht Demedts;,citation_author=Bartel Vanholme;,citation_author=Wout Boerjan;,citation_author=Paulo Mazzafera;,citation_publication_date=2013;,citation_cover_date=2013;,citation_year=2013;,citation_issue=6;,citation_doi=10.1093/jxb/ert045;,citation_isbn=1460-2431 (Electronic){\textbackslash}r0022-0957 (Linking);,citation_issn=00220957;,citation_pmid=23418623;,citation_volume=64;,citation_journal_title=J.

Recent findings suggest that the structure of the polymer produced de novo seems to largely depend on the type and intensity of the stress and on the plant species.

The tandem CCCH zinc finger (TZF) proteins involved in plant secondary wall formation are poorly understood. Two TZF genes, PdC3H17 and PdC3H18, were isolated from Populus deltoides and functionally characterized in Escherichia coli, tobacco, Arabidopsis and poplar. PdC3H17 and PdC3H18 are predominantly expressed in cells of developing wood, and the proteins they encode are targeted to cytoplasmic foci. Transcriptional activation assays showed that PdMYB2/3/20/21 individually activated the PdC3H17 and PdC3H18 promoters, but PdMYB3/21 were most significant. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that PdMYB3/21 bound directly to the PdC3H17/18 promoters. Overexpression of PdC3H17/18 in poplar increased secondary xylem width and secondary wall thickening in stems, whereas dominant repressors of them had the opposite effects on these traits. Similar alteration in secondary wall thickening was observed in their transgenic Arabidopsis plants. qRT-PCR results showed that PdC3H17/18 regulated the expression of cellulose, xylan and lignin biosynthetic genes, and several wood-associated MYB genes.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Interaction between Autonomous and Microtubule Guidance Systems Controls Cellulose Synthase Trajectories;,citation_abstract=The organization of cellulose microfibrils is critical for the strength and growth of plant cell walls. Microtubules have been shown to play a key role in controlling microfibril organization by guiding cellulose synthase complexes [1, 2, 3, 4]. However, cellulose synthase trajectories can be maintained when microtubules are removed by drugs, suggesting a separate guidance mechanism is also at play [1, 5, 6]. By slowing down microtubule dynamics, we reveal such a mechanism by showing that cellulose synthase complexes can interact with the trails left by other complexes, causing them to follow the trails or disappear. The stability of the trails, together with the sensitivity of their directions to cellulase treatment, indicates they most likely reflect nascent cellulose microfibrils. Over many hours, this autonomous mechanism alone can lead to a change in the dominant orientation of cellulose synthase trajectories. However, the mechanism can be overridden by the microtubule guidance system. Our findings suggest a dual guidance model, in which an autonomous system, involving interaction between cellulose synthases and microfibrils, can maintain aligned cellulose synthase trajectories, while a microtubule guidance system allows alignments to be steered by environmental and developmental cues.;,citation_author=Jordi Chan;,citation_author=Enrico Coen;,citation_publication_date=2020-03;,citation_cover_date=2020-03;,citation_year=2020;,citation_issue=5;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.cub.2019.12.066;,citation_issn=0960-9822;,citation_volume=30;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Curr.

We named this core collection the Linum usitatissimum (flax) lbf mutants for lignified bast fibers and believe that this population represents a novel biological resource for investigating how bast fiber plants regulate lignin biosynthesis. As a proof of concept, we characterized the lbf1 mutant and showed that the lignin content increased by 350% in outer stem tissues containing bast fibers but was unchanged in inner stem tissues containing xylem. Chemical and NMR analyses indicated that bast fiber ectopic lignin was highly condensed and rich in G-units. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry profiling showed large modifications in the oligolignol pool of lbf1 inner- and outer-stem tissues that could be related to ectopic lignification. Immunological and chemical analyses revealed that lbf1 mutants also showed changes to other cell wall polymers. Whole-genome transcriptomics suggested that ectopic lignification of flax bast fibers could be caused by increased transcript accumulation of (1) the cinnamoyl-CoA reductase, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase, and caffeic acid O-methyltransferase monolignol biosynthesis genes, (2) several lignin-associated peroxidase genes, and (3) genes coding for respiratory burst oxidase homolog NADPH-oxidases necessary to increase H2O2 supply.;,citation_author=Maxime Chantreau;,citation_author=Antoine Portelette;,citation_author=Rebecca Dauwe;,citation_author=Shingo Kiyoto;,citation_author=David Crônier;,citation_author=Kris Morreel;,citation_author=Sandrine Arribat;,citation_author=Godfrey Neutelings;,citation_author=Malika Chabi;,citation_author=Wout Boerjan;,citation_author=Arata Yoshinaga;,citation_author=François Mesnard;,citation_author=Sebastien Grec;,citation_author=Brigitte Chabbert;,citation_author=Simon Hawkins;,citation_publication_date=2014;,citation_cover_date=2014;,citation_year=2014;,citation_issue=11;,citation_doi=10.1105/tpc.114.130443;,citation_isbn=1532-298X (Electronic){\textbackslash}r1040-4651 (Linking);,citation_issn=1040-4651;,citation_pmid=25381351;,citation_volume=26;,citation_journal_title=Plant Cell;">

Thereby the cell wall deposition of lignin represents often the main molecular event that defines the biological function(s) of the lignified cell or tissue. The time and localization of lignin deposition as well as the composition of the polymer can be considered as the three essential components of the polymer that will define the biological function of the lignified tissue. In this review, we will cover the localizations, types and functions of lignin found in various part of land plants. Then, for the various lignified tissues, the mechanisms controlling the developmental deposition of lignin such as transcriptional regulation, intercellular coordinated control of lignification or posttranslational modification of proteins will be discussed.

The genes were organized in a tandem array with approximately 6 kb separating their coding regions. Quantitation of LapA mRNA levels in conjunction with nuclear run-on experiments indicated that LapA genes were primarily under transcriptional control after wounding and infection with Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato. In contrast, actin genes were down-regulated after pathogen infection. The sequences of the LapA1 and LapA2 5’-flanking regions were determined and several potential regulatory motifs were identified. Ribonuclease protection studies revealed that LapA1 and LapA2 had short 18-bp 5’-untranslated regions (UTR), both genes were expressed after wounding, and LapA1 mRNAs were 3.3-fold more abundant than LapA2 transcripts. While the region surrounding LapA1 was conserved, the 3’-UTRs and 3’-flanking regions of LapA2 had diverged in two inbred tomato lines. The accumulation of LapA mRNAs and of LAP-A (acidic pI), LAP-N (neutral pI) and LAP-related proteins were examined in two monocot and five dicot species.

The hydrolysis of these monolignol glucosides would involve \beta-glucosidase activities. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), in vitro studies have shown the affinity of \beta-GLUCOSIDASE45 (BGLU45) and BGLU46 for monolignol glucosides. BGLU45 and BGLU46 genes are expressed in stems. Immunolocalization experiments showed that BGLU45 and BGLU46 proteins are mainly located in the interfascicular fibers and in the protoxylem, respectively. Knockout mutants for BGLU45 or BGLU46 do not have a lignin-deficient phenotype. Coniferin and syringin could be detected by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry in Arabidopsis stems. Stems from BGLU45 and BGLU46 mutant lines displayed a significant increase in coniferin content without any change in coniferyl alcohol, whereas no change in syringin content was observed. Other glucosylated compounds of the phenylpropanoid pathway were also deregulated in these mutants, but to a lower extent. By contrast, BGLU47, which is closely related to BGLU45 and BGLU46, is not implicated in either the general phenylpropanoid pathway or in the lignification of stems and roots. These results confirm that the major in vivo substrate of BGLU45 and BGLU46 is coniferin and suggest that monolignol glucosides are the storage form of monolignols in Arabidopsis, but not the direct precursors of lignin.;,citation_author=Aurélie Chapelle;,citation_author=Kris Morreel;,citation_author=Ruben Vanholme;,citation_author=Philippe Le-Bris;,citation_author=Halima Morin;,citation_author=Catherine Lapierre;,citation_author=Wout Boerjan;,citation_author=Lise Jouanin;,citation_author=Nathalie Demont-Caulet;,citation_publication_date=2012;,citation_cover_date=2012;,citation_year=2012;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1104/pp.112.203364;,citation_isbn=0032-0889;,citation_issn=1532-2548;,citation_pmid=22984124;,citation_volume=160;,citation_journal_title=Plant Physiol.;">

The cloning of plant P450s has been hampered because these membrane-localized proteins are typically present in low abundance and are often unstable to purification. Since the cloning of the first plant P450 gene in 1990, there has been an explosion in the rate at which genes encoding plant P450s have been identified. These successes have largely been the result of advances in purification techniques, as well as the application of alternative methods such as mutant- and PCR-based cloning strategies. The availability of these cloned genes has made possible the analysis of P450 gene regulation and may soon reveal aspects of the evolution of P450s in plants. This new knowledge will significantly improve our understanding of many metabolic pathways and may permit their manipulation in the near future.;,citation_author=Clint Chapple;,citation_publication_date=1998;,citation_cover_date=1998;,citation_year=1998;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1146/annurev.arplant.49.1.311;,citation_isbn=1040-2519;,citation_issn=1040-2519;,citation_pmid=15012237;,citation_volume=49;,citation_journal_title=Annu.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=In silico Platform for Prediction of N-, O- and C-Glycosites in Eukaryotic Protein Sequences;,citation_abstract=Glycosylation is one of the most abundant and an important post-translational modification of proteins. Glycosylated proteins (glycoproteins) are involved in various cellular biological functions like protein folding, cell-cell interactions, cell recognition and host-pathogen interactions. A large number of eukaryotic glycoproteins also have therapeutic and potential technology applications. Therefore, characterization and analysis of glycosites (glycosylated residues) in these proteins is of great interest to biologists. In order to cater these needs a number of in silico tools have been developed over the years, however, a need to get even better prediction tools remains. Therefore, in this study we have developed a new webserver GlycoEP for more accurate prediction of N-linked, O-linked and C-linked glycosites in eukaryotic glycoproteins using two larger datasets, namely, standard and advanced datasets. In case of standard datasets no two glycosylated proteins are more similar than 40%; advanced datasets are highly non-redundant where no two glycosites’ patterns (as defined in methods) have more than 60% similarity. Further, based on our results with several algorihtms developed using different machine-learning techniques, we found Support Vector Machine (SVM) as optimum tool to develop glycosite prediction models. Accordingly, using our more stringent and non-redundant advanced datasets, the SVM based models developed in this study achieved a prediction accuracy of 84.26%, 86.87% and 91.43% with corresponding MCC of 0.54, 0.20 and 0.78, for N-, O- and C-linked glycosites, respectively. The best performing models trained on advanced datasets were then implemented as a user-friendly web server GlycoEP (http://www.imtech.res.in/raghava/glycoep/).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A Superfamily of Proteins with Novel Cysteine-Rich Repeats;,citation_abstract=One of the most intriguing discoveries from the studies of the last several years is the presence of a large number of genes encoding receptor-like protein kinases (RLKs) in plants. In Arabidopsis, there are at least 340 genes that code for proteins, each consisting of an N-terminal signal sequence, an extracellular receptor domain, a single transmembrane domain, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic Ser/Thr protein kinase domain (The Arabidopsis Genome Initiative, 2000). Plant RLKs are classified according to sequence motifs in the putative extracellular receptor domains (Hardie, 1999). One of the largest and best studied classes of RLKs is characterized by the Leu-rich repeat (LRR) known to be involved in protein-protein interaction (Walker, 1994). The second class includes the family of S-domain RLKs (SRKs) of Brassicaceae with high similarity to S-locus glycoproteins (SLGs) involved in the self-incompatibility response (Nasrallah et al., 1994). An S-domain contains a characteristic array of Cys residues and other conserved motifs (Walker, 1994). The third class, represented in Arabidopsis by LECRK1 and LRK1, contain a lectin-like extracellular domain that may bind oligosaccharides, such as the elcitors derived from breakdown of the cell wall (Herve et al., 1996). The wall-associated protein kinases represent a fourth class of RLKs that have extracellular domains containing sequence repeats related to mammalian epidermal growth factors (He et al., 1996). Other Arabidopsis RLKs contain additional types of extracellular domains. For example, PR5K has an extracellular domain related to the PR5 proteins that accumulate in the extracellular space in response to infection by microbial pathogens (Wang et al., 1996). Light repressible receptor protein kinase is an Arabidopsis RLK that has an extracellular domain with a novel Leu zipper motif (Deeken and Kaldenhoff, 1997).;,citation_author=Zhixiang Chen;,citation_publication_date=2001-06;,citation_cover_date=2001-06;,citation_year=2001;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1104/pp.126.2.473;,citation_issn=0032-0889;,citation_volume=126;,citation_journal_title=Plant Physiol.;">

The purified recombinant P. torridus TSase (PTTS) showed an optimum pH and temperature of 6.0 and 45 ^\circC, respectively, and the enzyme maintained high activity at pH 5.0 and 60 ^\circC. Kinetic analysis showed that the enzyme has a 2.5-fold higher catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) for maltose than for trehalose, indicating maltose as the preferred substrate. The maximum conversion rate of maltose into trehalose by the enzyme was independent of the substrate concentration, tended to increase at lower temperatures, and reached \approx71% at 20 ^\circC.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Macromolecular replication during lignin biosynthesis;,citation_abstract=Lignins play a crucial role in the cell-wall architecture of all vascular plants. They are composed of p-hydroxyphenylpropanoid units interconnected through covalent bonds formed during lignol radical coupling between six different pairs of atomic centers. For 50years, the primary structures of lignins have been thought to be random, but for a number of reasons such an assumption is not tenable. For example, it has been reported that, by simple physicochemical means, the rather recalcitrant lignins in spruce wood can be decisively separated into two fractions containing quite dissimilar biopolymer chains. Thus, a paradigm shift should be imminent, and a detailed working hypothesis for the mechanism of lignin biosynthesis would be invaluable in delineating how the process of macromolecular lignin assembly can be properly investigated. In conjunction with an earlier experimental result, an explicit model for a template dehydropolymerization process has been developed that describes how lignin primary structure is replicated. The strengths of the powerful noncovalent interactions have been calculated that control the transient placement of lignol radicals about to undergo coupling on a double-stranded lignin template. These elementary steps engender, in the growing daughter chain, a primary structure identical to that of the distal template strand. The interactions are governed by dynamical electron correlation in the \pi-orbitals of each immobilized lignol radical and the complementary aromatic ring in the antiparallel proximal strand. The resulting noncovalent forces are computed to be stronger than those stabilizing GC/CG base pairs in DNA double-helices, but the mechanism of replication is fundamentally different from that of any other biopolymer.;,citation_author=Yi-Ru Chen;,citation_author=Simo Sarkanen;,citation_publication_date=2010-03;,citation_cover_date=2010-03;,citation_year=2010;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.phytochem.2009.11.012;,citation_issn=0031-9422;,citation_volume=71;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Phytochemistry;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A polymer of caffeyl alcohol in plant seeds;,citation_abstract=Lignins are complex phenylpropanoid polymers mostly associated with plant secondary cell walls. Lignins arise primarily via oxidative polymerization of the three monolignols, p-coumaryl, coniferyl, and sinapyl alcohols. Of the two hydroxycinnamyl alcohols that represent incompletely methylated biosynthetic products (and are not usually considered to be monolignols), 5-hydroxyconiferyl alcohol is now well established as incorporating into angiosperm lignins, but incorporation of caffeyl alcohol has not been shown. We report here the presence of a homopolymer of caffeyl alcohol in the seed coats of both monocot and dicot plants. This polymer (C-lignin) is deposited to high concentrations in the seed coat during the early stages of seed development in the vanilla orchid (Vanilla planifolia), and in several members of the Cactaceae. The lignin in other parts of the Vanilla plant is conventionally biosynthesized from coniferyl and sinapyl alcohols. Some species of cacti contain only C-lignin in their seeds, whereas others contain only classical guaiacyl/syringyl lignin (derived from coniferyl and sinapyl alcohols). NMR spectroscopic analysis revealed that the Vanilla seed-coat polymer was massively comprised of benzodioxane units and was structurally similar to the polymer synthesized in vitro by peroxidase-catalyzed polymerization of caffeyl alcohol. CD spectroscopy did not detect any optical activity in the seed polymer. These data support the contention that the C-lignin polymer is produced in vivo via combinatorial oxidative radical coupling that is under simple chemical control, a mechanism analogous to that theorized for classical lignin biosynthesis.;,citation_author=Fang Chen;,citation_author=Y.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Specific amino acids affecting Drosophila melanogaster prophenoloxidase activity in vitro;,citation_abstract=Insect prophenoloxidase (PPO) is a key enzyme that induces melanization around invading pathogens and at wounds to prevent further infection. Drosophila melanogaster has three PPO genes which have different biochemical properties following over-expression in S2 cells. As shown by automatic melanization of S2 cells, recombinant PPO3 (rPPO3) became activated upon Cu2+ addition (Cu2+-aided cells melanization without ethanol activation and substrate addition: +Cu2+; -DOPA, -Ethanol). The exact reasons for this phenomenon are still unknown. In this study, using site-directed mutagenesis and over-expression methods, we found that the place holder, two independent amino acids (equal to Manduca sexta amino acid residues: F218 and S393 in MsPPO1, F224 and E395 in MsPPO2) in the active site pocket and a missing fragment (similar to 565RPGDPGT571 in MsPPO1 and 571QGSDPRR577 in MsPPO2) at the C-terminus of PPO3, affect rPPO3-S2 cells Cu2+-aided auto-melanization. Some mutations nearly rescued rPPO3 Cu2+-aided auto-activation, which suggests that the auto-activation of wild type rPPO3 was not due to cleavage by serine proteases. We also found that the corresponding amino acids in the active site pocket have similar effect on PPO1 as on PPO3. PPO1 staining activity (Cu2+ added or not during PPO transfection; cells melanized after ethanol activation and substrate addition: Cu2+; +DOPA, +Ethanol) has a positive relationship with the active site pocket size as does rPPO3. The fragment of rPPO1 corresponding to the one missing from the C-terminus of PPO3 has no influence on rPPO1 staining activity after it is deleted. However, the staining activities of rPPO2 mutants decreased after deletion of those corresponding amino acid sequences. When the corresponding fragments from PPO1 or PPO2 were inserted into PPO3, the mutant rPPO3 had no influence on staining activity, but had a significantly lowered Cu2+-aided auto-activation.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Monolignol Pathway 4-Coumaric Acid:Coenzyme A Ligases in Populus. Trichocarpa: Novel Specificity, Metabolic Regulation, and Simulation of Coenzyme A Ligation Fluxes;,citation_abstract=4-Coumaric acid:coenzyme A ligase (4CL) is involved in monolignol biosynthesis for lignification in plant cell walls. It ligates coenzyme A (CoA) with hydroxycinnamic acids, such as 4-coumaric and caffeic acids, into hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA thioesters. The ligation ensures the activated state of the acid for reduction into monolignols. In Populus spp., it has long been thought that one monolignol-specific 4CL is involved. Here, we present evidence of two monolignol 4CLs, Ptr4CL3 and Ptr4CL5, in Populus trichocarpa. Ptr4CL3 is the ortholog of the monolignol 4CL reported for many other species. Ptr4CL5 is novel. The two Ptr4CLs exhibited distinct Michaelis-Menten kinetic properties. Inhibition kinetics demonstrated that hydroxycinnamic acid substrates are also inhibitors of 4CL and suggested that Ptr4CL5 is an allosteric enzyme. Experimentally validated flux simulation, incorporating reaction/inhibition kinetics, suggested two CoA ligation paths in vivo: one through 4-coumaric acid and the other through caffeic acid. We previously showed that a membrane protein complex mediated the 3-hydroxylation of 4-coumaric acid to caffeic acid. The demonstration here of two ligation paths requiring these acids supports this 3-hydroxylation function. Ptr4CL3 regulates both CoA ligation paths with similar efficiencies, whereas Ptr4CL5 regulates primarily the caffeic acid path. Both paths can be inhibited by caffeic acid. The Ptr4CL5-catalyzed caffeic acid metabolism, therefore, may also act to mitigate the inhibition by caffeic acid to maintain a proper ligation flux. A high level of caffeic acid was detected in stem-differentiating xylem of P. trichocarpa. Our results suggest that Ptr4CL5 and caffeic acid coordinately modulate the CoA ligation flux for monolignol biosynthesis.;,citation_author=H.-C. Chen;,citation_author=J. Song;,citation_author=C. M.

We have now determined the lignin types in the seed coats of 130 different cactus species. Lignin in the vegetative tissues of cacti is of the normal guaiacyl/syringyl (G/S) type, but members of most genera within the subfamily Cactoidae possess seed coat lignin of the novel C-type only, which we show is a homopolymer formed by endwise \beta–O–4-coupling of caffeyl alcohol monomers onto the growing polymer, resulting in benzodioxane units. However, the species examined within the genera Coryphantha, Cumarinia, Escobaria and Mammillaria (Cactoideae) mostly had normal G/S lignin in their seeds, as did all six species in the subfamily Opuntioidae that were examined. Seed coat lignin composition is still evolving in the Cactaceae, as seeds of one Mammillaria species (M. lasiacantha) possess only C-lignin, three Escobaria species (E. dasyacantha, E. lloydii and E. zilziana) contain an unusual lignin composed of 5-hydroxy-guaiacyl units, the first report of such a polymer occurring naturally in plants, and seeds of some species contain no lignin at all.

A mathematical model was developed for the behavior of 4CL3 and 4CL5 individually and in mixtures that form the enzyme complex. The model incorporates effects of mixtures of multiple hydroxycinnamic acid substrates, competitive inhibition, uncompetitive inhibition, and self-inhibition, along with characteristic of the substrates, the enzyme isoforms, and the tetrameric complex. Kinetic analysis of different ratios of the enzyme isoforms shows both inhibition and activation components, which are explained by the mathematical model and provide insight into the regulation of metabolic flux for monolignol biosynthesis by protein complex formation.;,citation_author=Hsi-Chuan Chen;,citation_author=Jina Song;,citation_author=Jack P.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Anisotropic Cell Expansion Is Affected through the Bidirectional Mobility of Cellulose Synthase Complexes and Phosphorylation at Two Critical Residues on CESA3;,citation_abstract=Here we report that phosphorylation status of S211 and T212 of the CESA3 component of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) cellulose synthase impacts the regulation of anisotropic cell expansion as well as cellulose synthesis and deposition and microtubule-dependent bidirectional mobility of CESA complexes. Mutation of S211 to Ala caused a significant decrease in the length of etiolated hypocotyls and primary roots, while root hairs were not significantly affected. By contrast, the S211E mutation stunted the growth of root hairs, but primary roots were not significantly affected. Similarly, T212E caused a decrease in the length of root hairs but not root length. However, T212E stunted the growth of etiolated hypocotyls. Live-cell imaging of fluorescently labeled CESA showed that the rate of movement of CESA particles was directionally asymmetric in etiolated hypocotyls of S211A and T212E mutants, while similar bidirectional velocities were observed with the wild-type control and S211E and T212A mutant lines. Analysis of cell wall composition and the innermost layer of cell wall suggests a role for phosphorylation of CESA3 S211 and T212 in cellulose aggregation into fibrillar bundles. These results suggest that microtubule-guided bidirectional mobility of CESA complexes is fine-tuned by phosphorylation of CESA3 S211 and T212, which may, in turn, modulate cellulose synthesis and organization, resulting in or contributing to the observed defects of anisotropic cell expansion.;,citation_author=Shaolin Chen;,citation_author=Honglei Jia;,citation_author=Heyu Zhao;,citation_author=Dan Liu;,citation_author=Yanmei Liu;,citation_author=Boyang Liu;,citation_author=Stefan Bauer;,citation_author=Chris R.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Hierarchical Transcription Factor and Chromatin Binding Network for Wood Formation in Populus trichocarpa;,citation_abstract=Wood remains the world’s most abundant and renewable resource for timber and pulp and is an alternative to fossil fuels. Understanding the molecular regulation of wood formation can advance the engineering of wood for more efficient material and energy productions. We integrated a black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa) wood-forming cell system with quantitative transcriptomics and chromatin binding assays to construct a transcriptional regulatory network (TRN) directed by a key transcription factor (TF), PtrSND1-B1 (secondary wall-associated NAC-domain protein). The network consists of four layers of TF–target gene interactions with quantitative regulatory effects, describing the specificity of how the regulation is transduced through these interactions to activate cell wall genes (effector genes) for wood formation. PtrSND1-B1 directs 57 TF–DNA interactions through 17 TFs transregulating 27 effector genes. Of the 57 interactions, 55 are novel. We tested 42 of these 57 interactions in 30 genotypes of transgenic P. trichocarpa and verified that \sim90% of the tested interactions function in vivo. The TRN reveals common transregulatory targets for distinct TFs, leading to the discovery of nine TF protein complexes (dimers and trimers) implicated in regulating the biosynthesis of specific types of lignin. Our work suggests that wood formation may involve regulatory homeostasis determined by combinations of TF–DNA and TF–TF (protein–protein) regulations.;,citation_author=Hao Chen;,citation_author=Jack P.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Plant phenolics: Recent advances on their biosynthesis, genetics, and ecophysiology;,citation_abstract=Land-adapted plants appeared between about 480 and 360 million years ago in the mid-Palaeozoic era, originating from charophycean green algae. The successful adaptation to land of these prototypes of amphibious plants - when they emerged from an aquatic environment onto the land - was achieved largely by massive formation of &amp;amp;amp;quot;phenolic UV light screens&amp;quot;. In the course of evolution, plants have developed the ability to produce an enormous number of phenolic secondary metabolites, which are not required in the primary processes of growth and development but are of vital importance for their interaction with the environment, for their reproductive strategy and for their defense mechanisms.From a biosynthetic point of view, beside methylation catalyzed by O-methyltransferases, acylation and glycosylation of secondary metabolites, including phenylpropanoids and various derived phenolic compounds, are fundamental chemical modifications. Such modified metabolites have altered polarity, volatility, chemical stability in cells but also in solution, ability for interaction with other compounds (co-pigmentation) and biological activity.The control of the production of plant phenolics involves a matrix of potentially overlapping regulatory signals. These include developmental signals, such as during lignification of new growth or the production of anthocyanins during fruit and flower development, and environmental signals for protection against abiotic and biotic stresses. For some of the key compounds, such as the flavonoids, there is now an excellent understanding of the nature of those signals and how the signal transduction pathway connects through to the activation of the phenolic biosynthetic genes.Within the plant environment, different microorganisms can coexist that can establish various interactions with the host plant and that are often the basis for the synthesis of specific phenolic metabolites in response to these interactions. In the rhizosphere, increasing evidence suggests that root specific chemicals (exudates) might initiate and manipulate biological and physical interactions between roots and soil organisms. These interactions include signal traffic between roots of competing plants, roots and soil microbes, and one-way signals that relate the nature of chemical and physical soil properties to the roots. Plant phenolics can also modulate essential physiological processes such as transcriptional regulation and signal transduction. Some interesting effects of plant phenolics are also the ones associated with the growth hormone auxin. An additional role for flavonoids in functional pollen development has been observed. Finally, anthocyanins represent a class of flavonoids that provide the orange, red and blue/purple colors to many plant tissues. According to the coevolution theory, red is a signal of the status of the tree to insects that migrate to (or move among) the trees in autumn. © 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.;,citation_author=Véronique Cheynier;,citation_author=Gilles Comte;,citation_author=Kevin M.

However, the genetic pathway controlling defense-induced lignification remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate the Arabidopsis thaliana SG2-type R2R3-MYB transcription factor MYB15 as a regulator of defense-induced lignification and basal immunity. Loss of MYB15 reduces the content but not the composition of defense-induced lignin, whereas constitutive expression of MYB15 increases lignin content independently of immune activation. Comparative transcriptional and metabolomics analyses implicate MYB15 as necessary for the defense-induced synthesis of guaiacyl lignin and the basal synthesis of the coumarin metabolite scopoletin. MYB15 directly binds to the secondary wall MYB-responsive element consensus sequence, which encompasses the AC elements, to drive lignification. The myb15 and lignin biosynthetic mutants show increased susceptibility to the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae, consistent with defense-induced lignin having a major role in basal immunity. A scopoletin biosynthetic mutant also shows increased susceptibility independently of immune activation, consistent with a role in preformed defense. Our results support a role for phenylalanine-derived small molecules in preformed and inducible Arabidopsis defense, a role previously dominated by tryptophan-derived small molecules.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Synthesis and Self-Assembly of Cellulose Microfibrils from Reconstituted Cellulose Synthase;,citation_abstract=Cellulose, the major component of plant cell walls, can be converted to bioethanol and is thus highly studied. In plants, cellulose is produced by cellulose synthase, a processive family-2 glycosyltransferase. In plant cell walls, individual \beta-1,4-glucan chains polymerized by CesA are assembled into microfibrils that are frequently bundled into macrofibrils. An in vitro system in which cellulose is synthesized and assembled into fibrils would facilitate detailed study of this process. Here, we report the heterologous expression and partial purification of His-tagged CesA5 from Physcomitrella patens. Immunoblot analysis and mass spectrometry confirmed enrichment of PpCesA5. The recombinant protein was functional when reconstituted into liposomes made from yeast total lipid extract. The functional studies included incorporation of radiolabeled Glc, linkage analysis, and imaging of cellulose microfibril formation using transmission electron microscopy. Several microfibrils were observed either inside or on the outer surface of proteoliposomes, and strikingly, several thinner fibrils formed ordered bundles that either covered the surfaces of proteoliposomes or were spawned from liposome surfaces. We also report this arrangement of fibrils made by proteoliposomes bearing CesA8 from hybrid aspen. These observations describe minimal systems of membrane-reconstituted CesAs that polymerize \beta-1,4-glucan chains that coalesce to form microfibrils and higher-ordered macrofibrils. How these micro- and macrofibrils relate to those found in primary and secondary plant cell walls is uncertain, but their presence enables further study of the mechanisms that govern the formation and assembly of fibrillar cellulosic structures and cell wall composites during or after the polymerization process controlled by CesA proteins.;,citation_author=Sung Hyun Cho;,citation_author=Pallinti Purushotham;,citation_author=Chao Fang;,citation_author=Cassandra Maranas;,citation_author=Sara M.

Controversy has existed over the origin of ROS in plant defense. We have isolated a novel extracellular peroxidase gene, CaPO2, from pepper (Capsicum annuum). Local or systemic expression of CaPO2 is induced in pepper by avirulent Xanthomonas campestris pv vesicatoria (Xcv) infection.We examined the function of the CaPO2 gene in plant defense using the virus-induced gene silencing technique and gain-of-function transgenic plants. CaPO2-silenced pepper plants were highly susceptible to Xcv infection. Virus-induced gene silencing of the CaPO2 gene also compromised hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) accumulation and hypersensitive cell death in leaves, both locally and systemically, during avirulent Xcv infection. In contrast, overexpression of CaPO2 in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) conferred enhanced disease resistance accompanied by cell death, H2O2 accumulation, and PR gene induction. In CaPO2-overexpression Arabidopsis leaves infected by Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato,H2O2 generation was sensitive to potassium cyanide (a peroxidase inhibitor) but insensitive to diphenylene iodonium (anNADPHoxidase inhibitor), suggesting that H2O2 generation depends on peroxidase in Arabidopsis. Together, these results indicate that the CaPO2 peroxidase is involved in ROS generation, both locally and systemically, to activate cell death and PR gene induction during the defense response to pathogen invasion.

In Arabidopsis thaliana, a peroxidase (PRX64) and laccase (LAC4) are shown to localize differently within cell wall domains in interfascicular fibers: PRX64 localizes to the middle lamella whereas LAC4 localizes throughout the secondary cell wall layers. Similarly, laccases localized to, and are responsible for, the helical depositions of lignin in protoxylem tracheary elements. In addition, we tested the mobility of laccases in the cell wall using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. mCHERRY-tagged LAC4 was immobile in secondary cell wall domains, but mobile in the primary cell wall when ectopically expressed. A small secreted red fluorescent protein (sec-mCHERRY) was engineered as a control and was found to be mobile in both the primary and secondary cell walls. Unlike sec-mCHERRY, the tight anchoring of LAC4 to secondary cell wall domains indicated that it cannot be remobilized once secreted, and this anchoring underlies the spatial control of lignification.;,citation_author=Eva Yi Chou;,citation_author=Mathias Schuetz;,citation_author=Natalie Hoffmann;,citation_author=Yoichiro Watanabe;,citation_author=Richard Sibout;,citation_author=A.

The copper pair of tyrosinases binds one molecule of atmospheric oxygen to catalyse two different kinds of enzymatic reactions: (1) the ortho-hydroxylation of monophenols (cresolase activity) and (2) the oxidation of o-diphenols to o-diquinones (catecholase activity). The best-known function is the formation of melanins from l-tyrosine via l-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-dopa). The complicated hydroxylation mechanism at the active centre is still not completely understood, because nothing is known about their tertiary structure. One main reason for this deficit is that hitherto tyrosinases from eukaryotic sources could not be isolated in sufficient quantities and purities for detailed structural studies. This is not the case for prokaryotic tyrosinases from different Streptomyces species, having been intensively characterized genetically and spectroscopically for decades. The Streptomyces tyrosinases are non-modified monomeric proteins with a low molecular mass of ca. 30 kDa. They are secreted to the surrounding medium, where they are involved in extracellular melanin production. In the species Streptomyces, the tyrosinase gene is part of the melC operon. Next to the tyrosinase gene (melC2), this operon contains an additional ORF called melC1, which is essential for the correct expression of the enzyme. This review summarizes the present knowledge of bacterial tyrosinases, which are promising models in order to get more insights in structure, enzymatic reactions and functions of ’type 3 copper’ proteins in general. © 2005 Elsevier GmbH.

Plant tissue culture media, the hormone benzylamino purine and pH adjust-ment were unnecessary, and Agrobacterium could be applied to plants at a range of cell densities. Repeated application of Agrobacterium improved transformation rates and overall yield of transformants approximately twofold. Covering plants for 1 day to retain humidity after inoculation also raised transformation rates twofold. Multiple ecotypes were transformable by this method.

Dehydrated needles were frozen with liquid nitrogen, and xylem cross sections were observed, still frozen, with a cryo-scanning electron microscope and an epifluorescent microscope. Decrease in xylem pressure during drought provoked a progressive collapse of tracheids below a specific threshold pressure (Pcollapse) that correlates with the onset of cavitation in the stems. Pcollapse was more negative for species with smaller tracheid diameter and thicker walls, suggesting a tradeoff between xylem efficiency, xylem vulnerability to collapse, and the cost of wall stiffening. Upon severe dehydration, tracheid walls were completely collapsed, but lumens still appeared filled with sap. When dehydration proceeded further, tracheids embolized and walls relaxed. Wall collapse in dehydrated needles was rapidly reversed upon rehydration.

The growth characteristics of the reduced lignin trees were significantly impaired, resulting in smaller stems and reduced root biomass when compared to wild-type trees, as well as altered leaf morphology and architecture. The severe inhibition of cell wall lignification produced trees with a collapsed xylem phenotype, resulting in compromised vascular integrity, and displayed reduced hydraulic conductivity and a greater susceptibility to wall failure and cavitation. In the reduced lignin trees, photosynthetic carbon assimilation and stomatal conductance were also greatly reduced, however, shoot xylem pressure potential and carbon isotope discrimination were higher and water-use efficiency was lower, inconsistent with water stress. Reductions in assimilation rate could not be ascribed to increased stomatal limitation. Starch and soluble sugars analysis of leaves revealed that photosynthate was accumulating to high levels, suggesting that the trees with substantially reduced cell wall lignin were not carbon limited and that reductions in sink strength were, instead, limiting photosynthesis.;,citation_author=Heather D.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Genetic and Proteomic Analyses of Pupylation in Streptomyces coelicolor;,citation_abstract=Pupylation is a posttranslational modification peculiar to actinobacteria wherein proteins are covalently modified with a small protein called the prokaryotic ubiquitin-like protein (Pup). Like ubiquitination in eukaryotes, this phenomenon has been associated with proteasome-mediated protein degradation in mycobacteria. Here, we report studies of pupylation in a streptomycete that is phylogentically related to mycobacteria. We constructed mutants of Streptomyces coelicolor lacking PafA (Pup ligase), the proteasome, and the Pup-proteasome system. We found that these mutants share a high susceptibility to oxidative stress compared to that of the wild-type strain. Remarkably, we found that the pafA null mutant has a sporulation defect not seen in strains lacking the Pup-proteasome system. In proteomics experiments facilitated by an affinity-tagged variant of Pup, we identified 110 pupylated proteins in S. coelicolor strains having and lacking genes encoding the 20S proteasome. Our findings shed new light on this unusual posttranslational modification and its role in Streptomyces physiology. IMPORTANCE The presence of 20S proteasomes reminiscent of those in eukaryotes and a functional equivalent of ubiquitin, known as the prokaryotic ubiquitin-like protein (Pup), in actinobacteria have motivated reevaluations of protein homeostasis in prokaryotes. Though the Pup-proteasome system has been studied extensively in mycobacteria, it is much less understood in streptomycetes, members of a large genus of actinobacteria known for highly choreographed life cycles in which phases of morphological differentiation, sporulation, and secondary metabolism are often regulated by protein metabolism. Here, we define constituents of the pupylome in Streptomyces coelicolor for the first time and present new evidence that links pupylation and the oxidative stress response in this bacterium.

In order to determine if PPO could be important for the induced defense of other crop plants, plants from five plant families were surveyed for constitutive, wound-induced, and methyl jasmonate-induced PPO activity. In addition to tomato, PPO was most strongly induced by wounding or methyl jasmonate in tobacco and hybrid poplar. In these plants the response was also shown to be systemically induced by wounding. Two species, willow and soybean, had very high constitutive PPO activities yet showed no significant PPO induction. Most of the species tested had low constitutive levels of PPO activity, and low or no induction by wounding or methyl jasmonate.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A novel methionine aminopeptidase-2 inhibitor, PPI-2458, inhibits non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo;,citation_abstract=PURPOSE: Fumagillin and related compounds have potent antiproliferative activity through inhibition of methionine aminopeptidase-2 (MetAP-2). It has recently been reported that MetAP-2 is highly expressed in germinal center B cells and germinal center-derived non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas (NHL), suggesting an important role for MetAP-2 in proliferating B cells. Therefore, we determined the importance of MetAP-2 in normal and transformed germinal center B cells by evaluating the effects of MetAP-2 inhibition on the form and function of germinal centers and germinal center-derived NHL cells. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: To examine the activity of PPI-2458 on germinal center morphology, spleen sections from cynomolgus monkeys treated with oral PPI-2458 were analyzed. Antiproliferative activity of PPI-2458 was assessed on germinal center-derived NHL lines in culture. A MetAP-2 pharmacodynamic assay was used to determine cellular MetAP-2 inhibition following PPI-2458 treatment. Finally, inhibition of MetAP-2 and proliferation by PPI-2458 was examined in the human SR NHL line in culture and in implanted xenografts. RESULTS: Oral PPI-2458 caused a reduction in germinal center size and number in lymphoid tissues from treated animals. PPI-2458 potently inhibited growth (GI(50) = 0.2-1.9 nmol/L) of several NHL lines in a manner that correlated with MetAP-2 inhibition. Moreover, orally administered PPI-2458 significantly inhibited SR tumor growth, which correlated with inhibition of tumor MetAP-2 (&amp;amp;amp;gt;85% at 100 mg/kg) in mice. CONCLUSIONS: These results show the potent antiproliferative activity of PPI-2458 on NHL lines in vitro and oral antitumor activity in vivo and suggest the therapeutic potential of PPI-2458 as a novel agent for treatment of NHL should be evaluated in the clinical setting.;,citation_author=Andrew C.

Our previous discovery/deduction that a six-membered arogenate dehydratase (<i>ADT1–6</i>) gene family encodes the final step in Phe biosynthesis in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> raised the fascinating question whether individual ADT isoenzymes (or combinations thereof) differentially modulated carbon flux to lignins, proteins, etc. If so, unlike all other lignin pathway manipulations that target cell wall/cytosolic processes, this would be the first example of a plastid (chloroplast)-associated metabolic process influencing cell wall formation. Homozygous T-DNA insertion lines were thus obtained for five of the six ADTs and used to generate double, triple, and quadruple knockouts (KOs) in different combinations. The various mutants so obtained gave phenotypes with profound but distinct reductions in lignin amounts, encompassing a range spanning from near wild type levels to reductions of up to \sim68%. In the various KOs, there were also marked changes in guaiacyl:syringyl ratios ranging from \sim3:1 to 1:1, respectively; these changes were attributed to differential carbon flux into vascular bundles <i>versus</i> that into fiber cells. Laser microscope dissection/pyrolysis GC/MS, histochemical staining/lignin analyses, and <i>pADT</i>::<i>GUS</i> localization indicated that ADT5 preferentially affects carbon flux into the vascular bundles, whereas the <i>adt3456</i> knock-out additionally greatly reduced carbon flux into fiber cells. This plastid-localized metabolic step can thus profoundly differentially affect carbon flux into lignins in distinct anatomical regions and provides incisive new insight into different factors affecting guaiacyl:syringyl ratios and lignin primary structure.</p>;,citation_author=Oliver R.

Using confocal fluorescence microscopy and biochemical assays, we have found that full length FER-eGFP abundance at the plasma membrane is also regulated by mechanical stimulation, but through a separate, cysteine protease-dependent pathway. Like RALF1 treatment, both mechanical bending and mechanical wounding trigger a reduction in plasma membrane-localized, native promoter-driven FER-eGFP in Arabidopsis roots, hypocotyls, and cotyledons. However, pharmacological inhibition of protein trafficking and degradation suggests that while RALF1 induces clathrin-mediated endocytosis and subsequent degradation of FER-eGFP, mechanical stimulation triggers cleavage and/or degradation of FER-eGFP in a cysteine protease-dependent, clathrin-independent manner. Despite the stimulus-dependent differences in these two pathways, we found that both require early FER signaling components, including Ca2+ signaling, FER kinase activity, and the presence of LLG1, a FER-interacting protein with an essential role in FER-dependent signal transduction.;,citation_author=Cassidy S.

However, many host-pathogen interactions involve many genes of small to medium effect and exhibit quantitative resistance. We used the Arabidopsis-Botrytis pathosystem to explore the quantitative genetic architecture underlying host innate immune system in a population of Arabidopsis thaliana. By infecting a diverse panel of Arabidopsis accessions with four phenotypically and genotypically distinct isolates of the fungal necrotroph B. cinerea, we identified a total of 2,982 genes associated with quantitative resistance using lesion area and 3,354 genes associated with camalexin production as measures of the interaction. Most genes were associated with resistance to a specific Botrytis isolate, which demonstrates the influence of pathogen genetic variation in analyzing host quantitative resistance. While known resistance genes, such as receptor-like kinases (RLKs) and nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat proteins (NLRs), were found to be enriched among associated genes, they only account for a small fraction of the total genes associated with quantitative resistance. Using publically available co-expression data, we condensed the quantitative resistance associated genes into co-expressed gene networks. GO analysis of these networks implicated several biological processes commonly connected to disease resistance, including defense hormone signaling and ROS production, as well as novel processes, such as leaf development. Validation of single gene T-DNA knockouts in a Col-0 background demonstrate a high success rate (60%) when accounting for differences in environmental and Botrytis genetic variation.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Specific functions of individual class III peroxidase genes;,citation_abstract=In higher plants, class III peroxidases exist as large multigene families (e.g. 73 genes in Arabidopsis thaliana). The diversity of processes catalysed by peroxidases as well as the large number of their genes suggests the possibility of a functional specialization of each isoform. In addition, the fact that peroxidase promoter sequences are very divergent and that protein sequences contain both highly conserved domains and variable regions supports this hypothesis. However, two difficulties are associated with the study of the function of specific peroxidase genes: (i) the modification of the expression of a single peroxidase gene often results in no visible mutant phenotype, because it is compensated by redundant genes; and (ii) peroxidases show low substrate specificity in vitro resulting in an unreliable indication of peroxidase specific activity unless complementary data are available. The generalization of molecular biology approaches such as whole transcriptome analysis and recombinant DNA combined with biochemical approaches provide unprecedented tools for overcoming these difficulties. This review highlights progress made with these new techniques for identifying the specific function of individual class III peroxidase genes taking as an example the model plant A. thaliana, as well as discussing some other plants.;,citation_author=Claudia Cosio;,citation_author=Christophe Dunand;,citation_publication_date=2009;,citation_cover_date=2009;,citation_year=2009;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://arxiv.org/abs/1011.1669v3;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1093/jxb/ern318;,citation_isbn=1460-2431 (Electronic){\textbackslash}r0022-0957 (Linking);,citation_issn=00220957;,citation_pmid=19088338;,citation_volume=60;,citation_journal_title=J.

We analyzed in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana the localization of a zucchini isoperoxidase (APRX), previously purified thanks to its pectin binding ability. We confirmed that the protein is localized near the cell wall, mainly produced in the elongation area of the hypocotyls and respond to exogenous auxin. In addition, the ectopic overexpression of APRX induced changes in growth pattern and a significant reduction of endogenous indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) level. In agreement with these observations APRX showed an elevated in vitro auxin oxidase activity. We propose that APRX participates in the negative feedback regulation of auxin level and consequently terminates the hypocotyl elongation process.;,citation_author=Claudia Cosio;,citation_author=Loic Vuillemin;,citation_author=Mireille De Meyer;,citation_author=Claire Kevers;,citation_author=Claude Penel;,citation_author=Christophe Dunand;,citation_publication_date=2009;,citation_cover_date=2009;,citation_year=2009;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1007/s00425-008-0876-0;,citation_isbn=1432-2048 (Electronic){\textbackslash}r0032-0935 (Linking);,citation_issn=00320935;,citation_pmid=19116728;,citation_volume=229;,citation_journal_title=Planta;">

Here, we report the first functional characterization of PRX17 (At2g22420), one of the 73 members of this family in Arabidopsis thaliana. Localization of PRX17 was examined by transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana. Loss- and gain-of-function mutants in A. thaliana were studied. Regulation at the gene and protein levels was analyzed using beta-glucuronidase (GUS) activity, quantitative reverse transcriptase (qRT)-PCR, zymography, and chromatin immunoprecipitation. Phenotypes were characterized including lignin and xylan contents. PRX17 was expressed in various tissues, including vascular tissues, and PRX17 was localized to the cell wall. In prx17, the lignin content was reduced in the stem and siliques and bolting was delayed, while the opposite phenotype was observed in 35S:PRX17 plants, together with a significant increase of lignin and xylan immunofluorescence signal. Finally, we demonstrated that the transcription factor AGAMOUS-LIKE15 (AGL15) binds to the PRX17 promoter and regulates PRX17 expression level. This converging set of structural, transcriptomic and physiological data suggests that PRX17, under the control of AGL15, contributes to developmental programs by playing an essential role in regulating age-dependent lignified tissue formation, including changes in cell wall properties.;,citation_author=Claudia Cosio;,citation_author=Philippe Ranocha;,citation_author=Edith Francoz;,citation_author=Vincent Burlat;,citation_author=Yumei Zheng;,citation_author=Sharyn E.

We describe here a unique type of cell-death program in xylem fibers of hybrid aspen (Populus tremula x P. tremuloides) stems, including gradual degradative processes in both the nucleus and cytoplasm concurrently with the phase of active cell-wall deposition. Nuclear DNA integrity, as determined by TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling) and Comet (single-cell gel electrophoresis) assays, was compromised early during fiber maturation. In addition, degradation of the cytoplasmic contents, as detected by electron microscopy of samples fixed by high-pressure freezing/freeze substitution (HPF-FS), was gradual and resulted in complete loss of the cytoplasmic contents well before the loss of vacuolar integrity, which is considered to be the moment of death. This type of cell death differs significantly from that seen in xylem vessels. The loss of vacuolar integrity, which is thought to initiate cell degradative processes in the xylem vessels, is one of the last processes to occur before the final autolysis of the remaining cell contents in xylem fibers. High-resolution microarray analysis in the vascular tissues of Populus stem, combined with in silico analysis of publicly available data repositories, suggests the involvement of several previously uncharacterized transcription factors, ethylene, sphingolipids and light signaling as well as autophagy in the control of fiber cell death.;,citation_author=Charleen L.

These enzymes are involved in the oxidation of a variety of soil organic compounds. The MCO gene family of the ectomycorrhizal fungus Laccaria bicolor is composed of 11 genes divided into two distinct subfamilies corresponding to laccases (lcc) sensu stricto (lcc1 to lcc9), sharing a high sequence homology with the coprophilic Coprinopsis cinerea laccase genes, and to ferroxidases (lcc10 and lcc11) that are not present in C. cinerea. The fet3-like ferroxidase genes lcc10 and lcc11 in L. bicolor are each arranged in a mirrored tandem orientation with an ftr gene coding for an iron permease. Unlike C. cinerea, L. bicolor has no sid1/sidA gene for siderophore biosynthesis. Transcript profiling using whole-genome expression arrays and quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) revealed that some transcripts were very abundant in ectomycorrhizas (lcc3 and lcc8), in fruiting bodies (lcc7) or in the free-living mycelium grown on agar medium (lcc9 and lcc10), suggesting a specific function of these MCOs.

A number of parasite endopeptidases (including plasmepsins and falcipains) process the globin into small peptides. These peptides appear to be further digested to free amino acids by aminopeptidases, enzymes that catalyze the sequential cleavage of N-terminal amino acids from peptides. Aminopeptidases are classified into different evolutionary families according to their sequence motifs and preferred substrates. The aminopeptidase inhibitor bestatin can disrupt parasite development, suggesting that this group of enzymes might be a chemotherapeutic target. Two bestatin-susceptible aminopeptidase activities, associated with gene products belonging to the M1 and M17 families, have been described in blood-stage P. falciparum parasites, but it is not known whether one or both are required for parasite development. To establish whether inhibition of the M17 aminopeptidase is sufficient to confer antimalarial activity, we evaluated 35 aminoalkylphosphonate and phosphonopeptide compounds designed to be specific inhibitors of M17 aminopeptidases. The compounds had a range of activities against cultured P. falciparum parasites with 50% inhibitory concentrations down to 14 muM. Some of the compounds were also potent inhibitors of parasite aminopeptidase activity, though it appeared that many were capable of inhibiting the M1 as well as the M17 enzyme. There was a strong correlation between the potencies of the compounds against whole parasites and against the enzyme, suggesting that M17 and/or M1 aminopeptidases may be valid antimalarial drug targets.;,citation_author=Eithne Cunningham;,citation_author=Marcin Drag;,citation_author=Pawel Kafarski;,citation_author=Angus Bell;,citation_publication_date=2008;,citation_cover_date=2008;,citation_year=2008;,citation_issue=9;,citation_doi=10.1128/AAC.01327-07;,citation_isbn=1098-6596 (Electronic){\textbackslash}r0066-4804 (Linking);,citation_issn=00664804;,citation_pmid=18458130;,citation_volume=52;,citation_journal_title=Antimicrob.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Predictive Models of Genetic Redundancy in Arabidopsis thaliana;,citation_abstract=Genetic redundancy refers to a situation where an individual with a loss-of-function mutation in one gene (single mutant) does not show an apparent phenotype until one or more paralogs are also knocked out (double/higher-order mutant). Previous studies have identified some characteristics common among redundant gene pairs, but a predictive model of genetic redundancy incorporating a wide variety of features derived from accumulating omics and mutant phenotype data is yet to be established. In addition, the relative importance of these features for genetic redundancy remains largely unclear. Here, we establish machine learning models for predicting whether a gene pair is likely redundant or not in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana based on six feature categories: functional annotations, evolutionary conservation including duplication patterns and mechanisms, epigenetic marks, protein properties including posttranslational modifications, gene expression, and gene network properties. The definition of redundancy, data transformations, feature subsets, and machine learning algorithms used significantly affected model performance based on holdout, testing phenotype data. Among the most important features in predicting gene pairs as redundant were having a paralog(s) from recent duplication events, annotation as a transcription factor, downregulation during stress conditions, and having similar expression patterns under stress conditions. We also explored the potential reasons underlying mispredictions and limitations of our studies. This genetic redundancy model sheds light on characteristics that may contribute to long-term maintenance of paralogs, and will ultimately allow for more targeted generation of functionally informative double mutants, advancing functional genomic studies.;,citation_author=Siobhan A Cusack;,citation_author=Peipei Wang;,citation_author=Serena G Lotreck;,citation_author=Bethany M Moore;,citation_author=Fanrui Meng;,citation_author=Jeffrey K Conner;,citation_author=Patrick J Krysan;,citation_author=Melissa D Lehti-Shiu;,citation_author=Shin-Han Shiu;,citation_publication_date=2021-08;,citation_cover_date=2021-08;,citation_year=2021;,citation_issue=8;,citation_doi=10.1093/molbev/msab111;,citation_issn=1537-1719;,citation_volume=38;,citation_journal_title=Mol.

The Cu microRNAs, which are expressed during Cu deprivation, down-regulate several transcripts that encode for Cu proteins. Since plastocyanin is not targeted by the Cu microRNAs, a cofactor economy model has been proposed in which plants prioritize Cu for use in photosynthetic electron transport. However, defects in photosynthesis are classic symptoms of Cu deprivation, and priorities in Cu cofactor delivery have not been determined experimentally. Using hydroponically grown Populus trichocarpa (clone Nisqually-1), we have established a physiological and molecular baseline for the response to Cu deficiency. An integrated analysis showed that Cu depletion strongly reduces the activity of several Cu proteins including plastocyanin, and consequently, photosynthesis and growth are decreased. Whereas plastocyanin mRNA levels were only mildly affected by Cu depletion, this treatment strongly affected the expression of other Cu proteins via Cu microRNA-mediated transcript down-regulation. Polyphenol oxidase was newly identified as Cu regulated and targeted by a novel Cu microRNA, miR1444. Importantly, a spatiotemporal analysis after Cu resupply to previously depleted plants revealed that this micronutrient is preferentially allocated to developing photosynthetic tissues. Plastocyanin and photosynthetic electron transport efficiency were the first to recover after Cu addition, whereas recovery of the other Cu-dependent activities was delayed. Our findings lend new support to the hypothesis that the Cu microRNAs serve to mediate a prioritization of Cu cofactor use.

Light and electron microscopy (scanning and transmission) techniques provide complementary information from global through tissue, cell, subcellular, and suborganelle levels with high spatial resolution not available using other approaches. Conventional scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM/TEM) and ancillary approaches (FE-SEM, ESEM, Cryo-SEM, Cryo-TEM, SEM-EDX, TEM-EDX, and rapid freezing approaches) have greatly improved our finite understanding of the structure of wood cell walls and polymers and of the different morphological forms of wood decay described from light microscopy. SEM and FE-SEM have allowed for the three-dimensional structure of wood to be explored and the intimate nanostructure of the microfibrils and microfibril aggregates within cell wall layers to be revealed as well as providing new details on the interaction of microbes and their mechanisms of decay. The advent of electron tomography techniques with FE-TEM should provide intimate high-resolution three-dimensional imaging of wood ultrastructure and decay not possible previously. Additional imaging and analysis techniques that have been used to reveal aspects of wood (ultra)structure and chemistry (e.g., FTIR, Raman, XPS, ToF-SIMS, AFM, X-ray microtomography) continue to be developed and applied although the various light and electron microscopy approaches still remain the most widely used and influential.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Apoplastic Oxidative Burst Peroxidase in Arabidopsis Is a Major Component of Pattern-Triggered Immunity;,citation_abstract=In plants, reactive oxygen species (ROS) associated with the response to pathogen attack are generated by NADPH oxidases or apoplastic peroxidases. Antisense expression of a heterologous French bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) peroxidase (FBP1) cDNA in Arabidopsis thaliana was previously shown to diminish the expression of two Arabidopsis peroxidases (peroxidase 33 [PRX33] and PRX34), block the oxidative burst in response to a fungal elicitor, and cause enhanced susceptibility to a broad range of fungal and bacterial pathogens. Here we show that mature leaves of T-DNA insertion lines with diminished expression of PRX33 and PRX34 exhibit reduced ROS and callose deposition in response to microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs), including the synthetic peptides Flg22 and Elf26 corresponding to bacterial flagellin and elongation factor Tu, respectively. PRX33 and PRX34 knockdown lines also exhibited diminished activation of Flg22-activated genes after Flg22 treatment. These MAMP-activated genes were also downregulated in unchallenged leaves of the peroxidase knockdown lines, suggesting that a low level of apoplastic ROS production may be required to preprime basal resistance. Finally, the PRX33 knockdown line is more susceptible to Pseudomonas syringae than wild-type plants. In aggregate, these data demonstrate that the peroxidase-dependent oxidative burst plays an important role in Arabidopsis basal resistance mediated by the recognition of MAMPs.;,citation_author=A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Toward combined delignification and saccharification of wheat straw by a laccase-containing designer cellulosome;,citation_abstract=Efficient breakdown of lignocellulose polymers into simple molecules is a key technological bottleneck limiting the production of plant-derived biofuels and chemicals. In nature, plant biomass degradation is achieved by the action of a wide range of microbial enzymes. In aerobic microorganisms, these enzymes are secreted as discrete elements in contrast to certain anaerobic bacteria, where they are assembled into large multienzyme complexes termed cellulosomes. These complexes allow for very efficient hydrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose due to the spatial proximity of synergistically acting enzymes and to the limited diffusion of the enzymes and their products. Recently, designer cellulosomes have been developed to incorporate foreign enzymatic activities in cellulosomes so as to enhance lignocellulose hydrolysis further. In this study, we complemented a cellulosome active on cellulose and hemicellulose by addition of an enzyme active on lignin. To do so, we designed a dockerin-fused variant of a recently characterized laccase from the aerobic bacterium Thermobifida fusca The resultant chimera exhibited activity levels similar to the wild-type enzyme and properly integrated into the designer cellulosome. The resulting complex yielded a twofold increase in the amount of reducing sugars released from wheat straw compared with the same system lacking the laccase. The unorthodox use of aerobic enzymes in designer cellulosome machinery effects simultaneous degradation of the three major components of the plant cell wall (cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin), paving the way for more efficient lignocellulose conversion into soluble sugars en route to alternative fuels production.;,citation_author=Lital Davidi;,citation_author=Sarah Moraïs;,citation_author=Lior Artzi;,citation_author=Doriv Knop;,citation_author=Yitzhak Hadar;,citation_author=Yonathan Arfi;,citation_author=Edward A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The reaction of phloroglucinol in the presence of acid with lignin-containing materials;,citation_abstract=UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectrometry has been used to monitor the reaction of phloroglucinol (in the presence of hydrochloric acid) with high yield pulps. When papers made from such pulps are irradiated, coniferaldehyde residues are generated as judged by their reaction with phloroglucinol/HCl. Treatment of such papers with sodium borohydride reduces the coniferaldehyde residues and consequently no colour reaction with phloroglucinol/HCl is observed. Irradiation of these borohydride-reduced papers leads to the generation of coniferaldehyde entities as detected by phloroglucinol/HCl. Similar results were obtained using a thin section of abies wood. Irradiation of papers made from high yield pulps destroys coniferaldehyde residues on the one hand and generates them from other sources on the other hand. Examination of papers made from the morphological components of poplar showed that it is impossible to quantify the amount of lignin present by this colour test method. Thioacidolysis analysis of the fractions shows for all of them a higher proportion of syringyl than guaiacyl \beta-O-4 aryl ether linkages. In contrast, photocleavage of the \beta-O-4 aryl ether linkages is more important for the guaiacyl structures. This is in accordance with the observed higher sensitivity to UV light of softwood pulps compared with hardwood pulps. Also, the thioacidolysis experiments indicate that UV irradiation of the fractions maintains a stationary concentration of the coniferaldehyde structures. © 1995.;,citation_author=R. S.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Lignin primary structures and dirigent sites;,citation_abstract=Although lignin is the second most abundant plant substance in vascular plants, its mode of synthesis is still the subject of much debate. However, recent progress has provided crucial evidence to support the theory that lignin primary structure is controlled at the proteinaceous level. Evidence for control over lignin assembly has been demonstrated with the discovery of monomer-invariant aryl-O-ether linkages in lignins that upon alkaline cleavage release the corresponding monomers in equimolar amounts, regardless of monolignol composition. Current evidence would indicate that there are only a few native lignin primary structures, the entire sequences of which now need to be fully determined.

Recent advances made over the last decade are critically discussed, and placed in context with earlier studies largely dating back to the 1950s. Beginning with the recently established formation of phenylalanine in plants, each downstream biochemical conversion is described from the perspective of the mechanistic details known to this point. Particular emphasis is placed upon proteinaceous control of monolignol-derived radical–radical coupling processes, leading to lignans and lignins, as well as apparently related processes affording the various ellagitannins and phenolic terpenoids. The evidence for non-random macromolecular lignin assembly is discussed in detail, this being in contrast to earlier notions that such processes were random. The latter assumptions have largely resulted from a lack of robust analytical procedures and rigorous quantification, as well as a lack of incisive experimental design. In addition, the often-noted severe effects of modulating lignin compositions and contents on plant vascular tissue properties (i.e. in terms of compromised biophysical properties) are described herein, as well as the severe limitations as regards recent claims of compensatory “combinatorial chemistry” lignin formation.

We report here in contrast that the copper protein hemocyanin of the tarantula Eurypelma californicum exhibits two different functions. These occur at the same active site. While hemocyanin usually is an oxygen carrier, its function can be transformed totally to monophenoloxidase and o-diphenoloxidase activity after limited proteolysis with trypsin or chymotrypsin. N-acetyldopamine (NADA) is more effectively oxidized than L-dopa or dopamine. This irreversible functional switch of tarantula hemocyanin function is limited to the two subunits b and c of its seven subunit types. A conserved phenylalanine in the hemocyanin molecule acts as a placeholder for other substrates that are phenylalanine derivatives. The proteolytic cleavage removes an N-terminal fragment, including the critical phenylalanine residue, which opens an entrance for substrates.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Similar enzyme activation and catalysis in hemocyanins and tyrosinases;,citation_abstract=This review presents the common features and differences of the type 3 copper proteins with respect to their structure and function. In spite of these differences a common mechanism of activation and catalysis seems to have been preserved throughout evolution. In all cases the inactive proenzymes such as tyrosinase and catecholoxidase are activated by removal of an amino acid blocking the entrance channel to the active site. No other modification at the active site seems to be necessary to enable catalytic activity. Hemocyanins, the oxygen carriers in many invertebrates, also behave as silent inactive enzymes and can be activated in the same way. The molecular basis of the catalytic process is presented based on recent crystal structures of tyrosinase and hemocyanin. Minor conformational differences at the active site seem to decide about whether the active site is only able to oxidize diphenols as in catecholoxidase or if it is also able to o-hydroxylate monophenols as in tyrosinase. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Since TW formation was mainly performed on 2-year-old poplar models, an in vitro poplar that produces gelatinous fibers (G-fibers) while offering the same experimental advantages as herbaceous plants has been developed. Using specific cell wall staining techniques, wood structural features and lignin/cellulose distribution were both detailed in cross-sections obtained from the curved stem part of in vitro poplars. A supposed delay in the SCW lignification process in the G-fibers, along with the presence of a G-layer, could be observed in the juvenile plants. Moreover, in this G-layer, the immunolabeling of various polymers carried out in the SCW of TW has allowed detecting crystalline cellulose, arabinogalactans proteins, and rhamnogalacturonans I; however, homogalacturonans, xylans, and xyloglucans could not be found. Interestingly, extensins were detected in this typical adaptative or stress-induced structure. These observations were corroborated by a quantitation of the immunorecognized polymer distribution using gold particle labeling.

The recent application of 454 pyrosequencing to simultaneously sequence thousands of 16S rDNA sequences (pyrotags) has revolutionized the characterization of complex microbial communities. To date, studies based on 454 pyrotags have dominated the field, but sequencing platforms that generate many more sequence reads at much lower costs have been developed. Here, we use the Illumina sequencing platform to design a strategy for 16S amplicon analysis (iTags), and assess its generality, practicality and potential complications. We fabricated and sequenced paired-end libraries of amplified hyper-variable 16S rDNA fragments from sets of samples that varied in their contents, ranging from a single bacterium to highly complex communities. We adopted an approach that allowed us to evaluate several potential sources of errors, including sequencing artifacts, amplification biases, non-corresponding paired-end reads and mistakes in taxonomic classification.

We have identified the entire Asp aminotransferase gene family in Nicotiana benthamiana and isolated and cloned the genes encoding the isoenzymes with plastidic localization: NbAsp5 and NbPAT. Using a virus-induced gene silencing approach, we obtained N. benthamiana plants silenced for NbAsp5 and/or NbPAT. Phenotypic and metabolic analyses were conducted in silenced plants to investigate the specific roles of these enzymes in the biosynthesis of essential amino acids within the plastid. The NbAsp5 silenced plants had no changes in phenotype, exhibiting similar levels of free Asp and glutamate as control plants, but contained diminished levels of asparagine and much higher levels of lysine. In contrast, the suppression of NbPAT led to a severe reduction in growth and strong chlorosis symptoms. NbPAT silenced plants exhibited extremely reduced levels of asparagine and were greatly affected in their phenylalanine metabolism and lignin deposition. Furthermore, NbPAT suppression triggered a transcriptional reprogramming in plastid nitrogen metabolism. Taken together, our results indicate that NbPAT has an overlapping role with NbAsp5 in the biosynthesis of Asp and a key role in the production of phenylalanine for the biosynthesis of phenylpropanoids. The analysis of NbAsp5/NbPAT cosilenced plants highlights the central role of both plastidic aminotransferases in nitrogen metabolism; however, only NbPAT is essential for plant growth and development.;,citation_author=F.

In this review, we cover the evolution of knowledge of the structures, biosynthesis, and functions of the 5 major cell wall polymer types that range from deceptively simple to fiendishly complex. Along the way, we recognize some of the colorful historical figures who shaped cell wall research over the past 100 years. The shapeshifter analogy emerges more clearly as we examine the evolving proposals for how cell walls are constructed to allow growth while remaining strong, the complex signaling involved in maintaining cell wall integrity and defense against disease, and the ways cell walls adapt as they progress from birth, through growth to maturation, and in the end, often function long after cell death. We predict the next century of progress will include deciphering cell type–specific wall polymers; regulation at all levels of polymer production, crosslinks, and architecture; and how walls respond to developmental and environmental signals to drive plant success in diverse environments.;,citation_author=Deborah Delmer;,citation_author=Richard A Dixon;,citation_author=Kenneth Keegstra;,citation_author=Debra Mohnen;,citation_publication_date=2024-02;,citation_cover_date=2024-02;,citation_year=2024;,citation_doi=10.1093/plcell/koad325;,citation_issn=1040-4651;,citation_journal_title=Plant Cell;">

The G1/S and G2/M transitions are critical checkpoints controlled, in part, by cyclin-dependent kinases in the retinoblastoma (RBR)/E2F/DP pathway. Arabidopsis thaliana DPB is regulated by phosphorylation and targeted to proteasome-mediated proteolysis by the SCFSKP2A complex. In addition, DPB interacts in vivo with E2FC, because ectopic coexpression of E2FC and DPB produces severe developmental defects. To understand E2FC/DPB heterodimer function, we analyzed the effect of reducing E2FC mRNA levels with RNA interference. The e2fc-R plants developed organs with more but smaller cells and showed increased cell cycle marker gene expression and increased proliferative activity in developing leaves, meristems, and pericycle cells. This last feature produces plants with more lateral roots, consistent with an E2FC role in restricting lateral root initiation. The e2fc-R plants also show marked reductions in ploidy levels of mature leaves. These results indicate that the transition from cell division to the endocycle is sensitive to different pathways, E2FC/DPB being one of them. Our results show that E2FC/DPB is a key factor in controlling the balance between cell proliferation and the switch to the endocycle program.;,citation_author=Juan C.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Hydroxystilbenes Are Monomers in Palm Fruit Endocarp Lignins;,citation_abstract=© 2017 American Society of Plant Biologists. All Rights Reserved. Lignin, the plant cell wall polymer that binds fibers together but makes processing difficult, is traditionally formed from three monomers, the so-called monolignols (p-coumaryl, coniferyl, and sinapyl alcohols). Recently, we discovered, in grass lignins, a phenolic monomer that falls outside the canonical lignin biosynthetic pathway, the flavone tricin. As we show here, palm fruit (macaúba [Acrocomia aculeata], carnauba [Copernicia prunifera] , and coconut [Cocos nucifera]) endocarps contain lignin polymers derived in part from a previously unconsidered class of lignin monomers, the hydroxystilbenes, including the valuable compounds piceatannol and resveratrol. Piceatannol could be released from these lignins upon derivatization followed by reductive cleavage, a degradative method that cleaves \beta-ether bonds, indicating that at least a fraction is incorporated through labile ether bonds. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of products from the copolymerization of piceatannol and monolignols confirms the structures in the natural polymer and demonstrates that piceatannol acts as an authentic monomer participating in coupling and cross-coupling reactions during lignification. Therefore, palm fruit endocarps contain a new class of stilbenolignin polymers, further expanding the definition of lignin and implying that compounds such as piceatannol and resveratrol are potentially available in what is now essentially a waste product.;,citation_author=José Carlos Río;,citation_author=Jorge Rencoret;,citation_author=Ana Gutiérrez;,citation_author=Hoon Kim;,citation_author=John Ralph;,citation_publication_date=2017-08;,citation_cover_date=2017-08;,citation_year=2017;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1104/pp.17.00362;,citation_issn=0032-0889;,citation_pmid=28588115;,citation_volume=174;,citation_journal_title=Plant Physiol.;">

Previous efforts were not able to fully overcome this phenotype without settling in sugar yield upon saccharification. Here, we reintroduced CINNAMOYL-COENZYME A REDUCTASE1 (CCR1) expression specifically in the protoxylem and metaxylem vessel cells of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) ccr1 mutants. The resulting ccr1 ProSNBE:CCR1 lines had overcome the vascular collapse and had a total stem biomass yield that was increased up to 59% as compared with the wild type. Raman analysis showed that monolignols synthesized in the vessels also contribute to the lignification of neighboring xylary fibers. The cell wall composition and metabolome of ccr1 ProSNBE:CCR1 still exhibited many similarities to those of ccr1 mutants, regardless of their yield increase. In contrast to a recent report, the yield penalty of ccr1 mutants was not caused by ferulic acid accumulation but was (largely) the consequence of collapsed vessels.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Vessel- and ray-specific monolignol biosynthesis as an approach to engineer fiber-hypolignification and enhanced saccharification in poplar;,citation_abstract=Lignin is one of the main factors determining recalcitrance to processing of lignocellulosic biomass towards bio-based materials and fuels. Consequently, wood of plants engineered for low lignin content is typically more amenable to processing. However, lignin-modified plants often exhibit collapsed vessels and associated growth defects. Vessel-specific reintroduction of lignin biosynthesis in dwarfed low-lignin cinnamoyl-CoA reductase1 (ccr1) Arabidopsis mutants using the ProSNBE:AtCCR1 construct overcame the yield penalty while maintaining high saccharification yields, and showed that monolignols can be transported between the different xylem cells acting as “good neighbors” in Arabidopsis. Here, we translated this research into the bio-energy crop poplar. By expressing ProSNBE:AtCCR1 into CRISPR/Cas9-generated ccr2 poplars, we aimed for vessel-specific lignin biosynthesis to: (i) achieve growth restoration while maintaining high saccharification yields; and (ii) study the existence of “good neighbors” in poplar wood. Analyzing the resulting ccr2 ProSNBE:AtCCR1 poplars showed that vessels and rays act as good neighbors for lignification in poplar. If sufficient monolignols are produced by these cells, monolignols migrate over multiple cell layers, resulting in a restoration of the lignin amount to wild-type levels. If the supply of monolignols is limited, the monolignols are incorporated into the cell walls of the vessels and rays producing them and their adjoining cells resulting in fiber hypolignification. One such fiber-hypolignified line had 18% less lignin and, despite its small yield penalty, had an increase of up to 71% in sugar release on a plant base upon saccharification.;,citation_author=Barbara De Meester;,citation_author=Ruben Vanholme;,citation_author=Lisanne Vries;,citation_author=Marlies Wouters;,citation_author=Jan Van Doorsselaere;,citation_author=Wout Boerjan;,citation_publication_date=2021;,citation_cover_date=2021;,citation_year=2021;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1111/tpj.15468;,citation_issn=1365-313X;,citation_volume=108;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Plant J.;">

Here, we focus on results that have been obtained by engineering the lignin biosynthesis and branching pathways in forest trees to reduce cell-wall recalcitrance, including the introduction of exotic lignin monomers. In addition, we draw general conclusions from over 20 years of field trial research with trees engineered to produce less or altered lignin.

This plant peroxidase was found to have an in vitro polymerization activity similar to the commonly used horseradish peroxidase. The selected polymerization conditions lead to a bulk polymerization mechanism when G alcohol was the only phenolic substrate available. In the same conditions, the presence of S alcohol at a 50/50 S/G molar ratio turned this bulk mechanism into an endwise one. A kinetics monitoring (size-exclusion chromatography and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry) of the different species formed during the first 24 h oxidation of the S/G mixture allowed sequencing the bondings responsible for oligomerization. Whereas G homodimers and GS heterodimers exhibit low reactivity, the SS pinoresinol structure act as a nucleating site of the polymerization through an endwise process.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Over the rainbow: A practical guide for fluorescent protein selection in plant FRET experiments;,citation_abstract=Receptor-like kinases (RLK) and receptor-like proteins (RLP) often interact in a combinatorial manner depending on tissue identity, membrane domains, or endo- and exogenous cues, and the same RLKs or RLPs can generate different signaling outputs depending on the composition of the receptor complexes they are involved in. Investigation of their interaction partners in a spatial and dynamic way is therefore of prime interest to understand their functions. This is, however, limited by the technical complexity of assessing it in endogenous conditions. A solution to close this gap is to determine protein interaction directly in the relevant tissues at endogenous expression levels using Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET). The ideal fluorophore pair for FRET must, however, fulfil specific requirements: (a) The emission and excitation spectra of the donor and acceptor, respectively, must overlap; (b) they should not interfere with proper folding, activity, or localization of the fusion proteins; (c) they should be sufficiently photostable in plant cells. Furthermore, the donor must yield sufficient photon counts at near-endogenous protein expression levels. Although many fluorescent proteins were reported to be suitable for FRET experiments, only a handful were already described for applications in plants. Herein, we compare a range of fluorophores, assess their usability to study RLK interactions by FRET-based fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) and explore their differences in FRET efficiency.

Quantitative proteomic analysis of microtubule pull-downs, using ratiometric (14)N/(15)N labeling, revealed 605 proteins exhibiting differential accumulation during TE differentiation. Microtubule interacting proteins associated with membrane trafficking, protein synthesis, DNA/RNA binding, and signal transduction peaked during secondary cell wall formation, while proteins associated with stress peaked when approaching TE cell death. In particular, CELLULOSE SYNTHASE-INTERACTING PROTEIN1, already associated with primary wall synthesis, was enriched during secondary cell wall formation. RNAi knockdown of genes encoding several of the identified proteins showed that secondary wall formation depends on the coordinated presence of microtubule interacting proteins with nonoverlapping functions: cell wall thickness, cell wall homogeneity, and the pattern and cortical location of the wall are dependent on different proteins.

Purification to apparent homogeneity of A. lipoferum laccase was achieved after cell disruption by sonication, protein solubilization by Triton X-100, acetone and protamine precipitation, hydroxyapatite column chromatography in the presence of urea (5 M) and NaCl (2 M), and finally by conventional hydroxyapatite column chromatography. After this final step, laccase was in an inactive form but could be reactivated by adding sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Based on gel electrophoresis results, we suggest that native A. lipoferum laccase is composed of a catalytic polypeptide chain with low molecular mass (16.3 kDa) and one or two regulatory/structural chains with high molecular mass (81.5 kDa).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Small glycosylated lignin oligomers are stored in Arabidopsis leaf vacuoles.;,citation_abstract=Lignin is an aromatic polymer derived from the combinatorial coupling of monolignol radicals in the cell wall. Recently, various glycosylated lignin oligomers have been revealed in Arabidopsis thaliana. Given that monolignol oxidation and monolignol radical coupling are known to occur in the apoplast, and glycosylation in the cytoplasm, it raises questions about the subcellular localization of glycosylated lignin oligomer biosynthesis and their storage. By metabolite profiling of Arabidopsis leaf vacuoles, we show that the leaf vacuole stores a large number of these small glycosylated lignin oligomers. Their structural variety and the incorporation of alternative monomers, as observed in Arabidopsis mutants with altered monolignol biosynthesis, indicate that they are all formed by combinatorial radical coupling. In contrast to the common believe that combinatorial coupling is restricted to the apoplast, we hypothesized that the aglycones of these compounds are made within the cell. To investigate this, leaf protoplast cultures were cofed with 13C6-labeled coniferyl alcohol and a 13C4-labeled dimer of coniferyl alcohol. Metabolite profiling of the cofed protoplasts provided strong support for the occurrence of intracellular monolignol coupling. We therefore propose a metabolic pathway involving intracellular combinatorial coupling of monolignol radicals, followed by oligomer glycosylation and vacuolar import, which shares characteristics with both lignin and lignan biosynthesis.;,citation_author=Oana Dima;,citation_author=Kris Morreel;,citation_author=Bartel Vanholme;,citation_author=Hoon Kim;,citation_author=John Ralph;,citation_author=Wout Boerjan;,citation_publication_date=2015;,citation_cover_date=2015;,citation_year=2015;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1105/tpc.114.134643;,citation_isbn=1532-298X (Electronic){\textbackslash}r1040-4651 (Linking);,citation_issn=1532-298X;,citation_pmid=25700483;,citation_volume=27;,citation_journal_title=Plant Cell;">

In plants PPOs appear in gene families, and the corresponding isoenzymes are located to the thylakoid lumen of chloroplasts. Although plant PPOs are often discussed with regard to their role in defense reactions, a common physiological function has not yet been defined. We analyzed a tetrameric PPO isoenzyme (PPO-6) from dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli, and found it to display cooperativity in catalysis, a phenomenon that has rarely been shown for plant PPOs previously. The identification of a surface-exposed cysteine (197) through molecular modeling followed by site-directed mutagenesis proved this amino acid residue to stabilize the tetramer via a disulfide linkage. The C197S-mutein still forms a tetrameric structure but shows impaired enzymatic efficiency and cooperativity and a reduction in stability. These findings indicate that oligomerization may be a physiological requirement for PPO-6 stability and function in vivo and raise new questions regarding distinct functions for specific PPO isoenzymes in plants.;,citation_author=Mareike E.

Laccase is hypothesized to play an important role in insect cuticle sclerotization by oxidizing catechols in the cuticle to their corresponding quinones, which then catalyze protein cross-linking reactions. To facilitate studies of the structure, function and regulation of insect laccases, we have cloned two cDNAs for laccases from the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta (MsLac1 and 2), and one from the malaria mosquito, Anopheles gambiae (AgLac1). The MsLac1 and 2 cDNAs encode proteins of 801 amino acids (aa) and 760 aa, respectively, while the AgLac1 cDNA encodes a protein of 1009 aa. All three cDNAs contain putative secretion signal sequences, and the 10 histidines and one cysteine that form the copper-binding centers, as well as a methionine in the T1 copper center. Novel to the insect laccases, relative to both fungal and plant laccases, is a longer amino-terminal sequence characterized by a unique domain consisting of several conserved cysteine, aromatic, and charged residues. Northern blot analyses identified single transcripts of approximately 3.6, 3.5, and 4.4 kb for MsLac1, MsLac2, and AgLac1, respectively, and also showed that AgLac1 was expressed in all life stages of the mosquito. RT-PCR revealed that the MsLac1 transcript was most abundant in the midgut, Malpighian tubules, and epidermis, whereas the MsLac2 transcript was most abundant in the epidermis. MsLac2 showed strong expression in the pharate pupal and reduced expression in the early pupal epidermis, consistent with the laccases’ presumed role in cuticle sclerotization. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Lignin biosynthesis: Old roads revisited and new roads explored;,citation_abstract=Lignin is a major component of secondarily thickened plant cell walls and is considered to be the second most abundant biopolymer on the planet. At one point believed to be the product of a highly controlled polymerization procedure involving just three potential monomeric components (monolignols), it is becoming increasingly clear that the composition of lignin is quite flexible. Furthermore, the biosynthetic pathways to the major monolignols also appear to exhibit flexibility, particularly as regards the early reactions leading to the formation of caffeic acid from coumaric acid. The operation of parallel pathways to caffeic acid occurring at the level of shikimate esters or free acids may help provide robustness to the pathway under different physiological conditions. Several features of the pathway also appear to link monolignol biosynthesis to both generation and detoxification of hydrogen peroxide, one of the oxidants responsible for creating monolignol radicals for polymerization in the apoplast. Monolignol transport to the apoplast is not well understood. It may involve passive diffusion, although this may be targeted to sites of lignin initiation/polymerization by ordered complexes of both biosynthetic enzymes on the cytosolic side of the plasma membrane and structural anchoring of proteins for monolignol oxidation and polymerization on the apoplastic side. We present several hypothetical models to illustrate these ideas and stimulate further research.

Stomatal closure of N-deprived plants was not associated with a decreased shoot water potential (\psishoot); conversely \psishoot was lower in N-supplied plants. N deprivation transiently (days 2 and 3) alkalized (0.2-0.3 pH units) xylem sap exuded from de-topped root systems under root pressure, and xylem sap expressed from excised shoots by pressurization. The ABA concentration of expressed sap increased 3-4-fold when measured on days 2 and 4. On day 2, leaves detached from N-deprived and N-supplied plants showed decreased transpiration rates when fed an alkaline (pH 7) artificial xylem (AX) solution, independent of the ABA concentration (10-100 nM) supplied. Thus changes in xylem sap composition following N deprivation can potentially close stomata. However, the lower transpiration rate of detached N-deprived leaves relative to N-supplied leaves shows that factors residing within N-deprived leaves also mediate stomatal closure, and that these factors assume greater importance as the duration of N deprivation increases.;,citation_author=I.

By contrast, the semidominant MED5b mutation reduced epidermal fluorescence4-3 (ref4-3) results in dwarfism and constitutively repressed phenylpropanoid accumulation. Here, we report the results of a forward genetic screen for suppressors of ref4-3. We identified 13 independent lines that restore growth and/or phenylpropanoid accumulation in the ref4-3 background. Two of the suppressors restore growth without restoring soluble phenylpropanoid accumulation, indicating that the growth and metabolic phenotypes of the ref4-3 mutant can be genetically disentangled. Whole-genome sequencing revealed that all but one of the suppressors carry mutations in MED5b or other Mediator subunits. RNA-seq analysis showed that the ref4-3 mutation causes widespread changes in gene expression, including the upregulation of negative regulators of the phenylpropanoid pathway, and that the suppressors reverse many of these changes.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A two-way molecular dialogue between embryo and endosperm is required for seed development;,citation_abstract=Filling in the gaps In a plant seed, the embryo lies dormant surrounded by nutritive endosperm while awaiting suitable conditions to germinate. A hydrophobic cuticle around the embryo protects it from catastrophic water loss during the early days of growth. Doll et al. identified a back-and-forth signaling pathway that ensures an intact cuticle. The precursor of a signaling peptide is made in the embryo and transferred to the endosperm, where it is processed into an active form. The activated peptide diffuses back into the embryo to activate receptor-like kinases that drive cuticle development. Serve and return continues until all leaks in the cuticle are filled in and the peptide can no longer cross the barrier. Science, this issue p. 431 The plant embryonic cuticle is a hydrophobic barrier deposited de novo by the embryo during seed development. At germination, it protects the seedling from water loss and is, thus, critical for survival. Embryonic cuticle formation is controlled by a signaling pathway involving the ABNORMAL LEAF SHAPE1 subtilase and the two GASSHO receptor-like kinases. We show that a sulfated peptide, TWISTED SEED1 (TWS1), acts as a GASSHO ligand. Cuticle surveillance depends on the action of the subtilase, which, unlike the TWS1 precursor and the GASSHO receptors, is not produced in the embryo but in the neighboring endosperm. Subtilase-mediated processing of the embryo-derived TWS1 precursor releases the active peptide, triggering GASSHO-dependent cuticle reinforcement in the embryo. Thus, a bidirectional molecular dialogue between embryo and endosperm safeguards cuticle integrity before germination.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Mechanical constraints on lignin deposition during lignification;,citation_abstract=The ultrastructure of lignifying cell walls in Pinus radiata D.Don was investigated using potassium permanganate staining and transmission electron microscopy. Lignin deposition occurred at numerous discrete sites within various cell wall regions, suggesting the presence of some initiating agent at these sites. In the middle lamella region, lignin deposition occurred by addition of protolignin monomers to spherical particles of lignin. Lignification was completed by expansion of these spherical particles, initially forming irregular patterns of lignification followed by infilling of adjacent areas. In contrast, lignification in the secondary wall occurred by deposition of protolignin monomers onto the ends of expanding lignin lamellae between cellulose microfibrils leading to greatly elongated patches of lignin due to the greater rate of deposition along the microfibril axis compared to that across it. It is concluded that the cellulose matrix in which lignin deposition occurs, in the secondary wall, can exert a mechanical influence which limits the rate of lignin deposition in the direction perpendicular to the microfibril axis.;,citation_author=L.

Using UV excitation, fluorescence spectra of normal and compression wood sections showed significant differences, especially in the outer secondary cell wall of tracheids, with a shift in maxima from violet to blue wavelengths between normal and compression wood. A comparison of normal wood, mild and severe compression wood, showed that the wavelength shift was intermediate in the mild compression wood compared to the severe compression wood, thus offering the possibility of quantifying the severity by measuring ratios of fluorescence at violet and blue wavelengths. Fluorescence induced by blue light, rather than UV, was less well differentiated amongst wood types. Spectral deconvolution indicated the presence of a minimum of five discrete lignin fluorophores in the cell walls of both normal and compression wood tracheids. Comparison with lignin model compounds suggest that the wavelength shift may correspond in part to increased levels of p-hydroxy type lignin in the compression wood samples.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Fluorescence lifetime imaging of lignin autofluorescence in normal and compression wood;,citation_abstract=Wood cell walls fluoresce as a result of UV and visible light excitation due to the presence of lignin. Fluorescence spectroscopy has revealed characteristic spectral differences in various wood types, notably normal and compression wood. In order to extend this method of characterising cell walls we examined the fluorescence lifetime of wood cell walls using TCSPC (Time-Correlated Single Photon Counting) as a method of potentially detecting differences in lignin composition and measuring the molecular environment within cell walls. The fluorescence decay curves of both normal and compression wood from pine contain three exponential decay components with a mean lifetime of \taum = 473 ps in normal wood and 418 ps in compression wood. Lifetimes are spatially resolved to different cell wall layers or cell types where individual lifetimes are shown to have a log-normal distribution. The differences in fluorescence lifetime observed in pine compression wood compared to normal wood, are associated with known differences in cell wall composition such as increased p-hydroxyphenyl content in lignin as well as novel deposition of \beta(1,4)-Galactan. Our results indicate increased deposition of lignin fluorophores with shorter lifetimes in the outer secondary wall of compression wood. We have demonstrated the usefulness of fluorescence lifetime imaging for characterising wood cell walls, offering some advantages over conventional fluorescence imaging/spectroscopy.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Softwood and Hardwood Lignin Fluorescence Spectra of Wood Cell Walls in Different Mounting Media;,citation_abstract=Wood cell walls are naturally fluorescent due to the presence of lignin. Autofluorescence offers a more specific method for localising lignin than staining and can potentially be used to assess cell wall modification resulting from a range of biological, chemical and physical treatments. In order to optimise conditions for imaging lignin by autofluorescence and to evaluate possible differences in fluorescence between softwood and hardwood lignin, wood sections of radiata pine and poplar were examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy to measure fluorescence spectra in a range of mounting media. Glycerol/buffer mixtures at three different pH values were compared with immersion oil and thiodiethanol using both UV and visible excitation. Glycerol/buffer at pH9 produced the strongest lignin fluorescence at visible excitation indicating that this is the optimal mounting medium for imaging and spectroscopy. For UV excitation, thiodiethanol gave increased brightness relative to glycerol. Poplar lignin was four times brighter than pine lignin with excitation at 488 nm at pH9, and showed characteristic differences in spectral emission under these conditions. This characteristic fluorescence was localised to the inner secondary wall of fibres, expressed as a gradient from the outer S2 region increasing towards the lumen, as visualised by spectral unmixing. Comparison with sapwood from other hardwood species suggests that this fluorescence emission is characteristic of poplar and willow (Salicaceae).

Comparison of needles in different physiological states demonstrated the loss of chlorophyll in both chlorotic and necrotic needles. Necrotic needles showed a dramatic change in the fluorescence of extractives within mesophyll cells from ultraviolet (UV) excited weak blue fluorescence to blue excited strong green fluorescence associated with tissue browning. Comparisons were made among fluorophores in terms of optimal excitation, relative brightness compared to lignin, and the effect of pH of mounting medium. Fluorophores in cell walls and extractives in lumens were associated with blue or green emission, compared to the red emission of chlorophyll.

It is very challenging to track individual vesicles and their cargos in real time; however, affinity purification allows vesicles to be isolated in their natural state so that their constituent proteins can be identified. Pioneering this approach in plants, we isolated the SYP61 trans-Golgi network compartment and carried out a comprehensive proteomic analysis of its contents with only minimal interference from other organelles. The proteome of SYP61 revealed the association of proteins of unknown function that have previously not been ascribed to this compartment. We identified a complete SYP61 SNARE complex, including regulatory proteins and validated the proteome data by showing that several of these proteins associated with SYP61 in planta. We further identified the SYP121-complex and cellulose synthases, suggesting that SYP61 plays a role in the exocytic trafficking and the transport of cell wall components to the plasma membrane. The presence of proteins of unknown function in the SYP61 proteome including ECHIDNA offers the opportunity to identify novel trafficking components and cargos. The affinity purification of plant vesicles in their natural state provides a basis for further analysis and dissection of complex endomembrane networks.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Universal fractionation of lignin-carbohydrate complexes (LCCs) from lignocellulosic biomass: An example using spruce wood;,citation_abstract=It is of both theoretical and practical importance to develop a universally applicable approach for the fractionation and sensitive lignin characterization of lignin-carbohydrate complexes (LCCs) from all types of lignocellulosic biomass, both natively and after various types of processing. In the present study, a previously reported fractionation approach that is applicable for eucalyptus (hardwood) and flax (non-wood) was further improved by introducing an additional step of barium hydroxide precipitation to isolate the mannan-enriched LCC (glucomannan-lignin, GML), in order to suit softwood species as well. Spruce wood was used as the softwood sample. As indicated by the recovery yield and composition analysis, all of the lignin was recovered in three LCC fractions: a glucan-enriched fraction (glucan-lignin, GL), a mannan-enriched fraction (GML) and a xylan-enriched fraction (xylan-lignin, XL). All of the LCCs had high molecular masses and were insoluble or barely soluble in a dioxane/water solution. Carbohydrate and lignin signals were observed in (1) H NMR, (13) C CP-MAS NMR and normal- or high-sensitivity 2D HSQC NMR analyses. The carbohydrate and lignin constituents in each LCC fraction are therefore believed to be chemically bonded rather than physically mixed with one another.

Taking advantage of the low degree of linkage disequilibrium (LD) within P. tomentosa association populations, we examined associations between 15 cellulose synthase (PtoCesA) genes and traits including growth and wood properties. Thirty-six novel simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers within PtoCesA genes were detected by re-sequencing and genotyped in an association population (460 individuals). Single-marker and haplotype-based LD approaches were used to identify significant marker-trait associations. Family-based linkage studies and real-time PCR testing were conducted to validate the functional significance of SSR variation. Fifteen single-marker associations from seven PtoCesA genes and nine haplotype-based associations within six genes were identified in the association population (false discovery rate Q &amp;amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Next, five SSR marker-trait associations (Q &amp;lt; 0.05) from four PtoCesA genes were successfully validated in a linkage mapping population (1200 individuals).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Analysis of lignin–carbohydrate and lignin–lignin linkages after hydrolase treatment of xylan–lignin, glucomannan–lignin and glucan–lignin complexes from spruce wood;,citation_abstract=Xylan–lignin (XL), glucomannan–lignin (GML) and glucan–lignin (GL) complexes were isolated from spruce wood, hydrolyzed with xylanase or endoglucanase/\beta-glucosidase, and analyzed by analytical pyrolysis and 2D-NMR. The enzymatic hydrolysis removed most of the polysaccharide moieties in the complexes, and the lignin content and relative abundance of lignin–carbohydrate linkages increased. Analytical pyrolysis confirmed the action of the enzymatic hydrolysis, with strong decreases of levoglucosane and other carbohydrate-derived products. Unexpectedly it also revealed that the hydrolase treatment alters the pattern of lignin breakdown products, resulting in higher amounts of coniferyl alcohol. From the anomeric carbohydrate signals in the 2D-NMR spectra, phenyl glycoside linkages (undetectable in the original complexes) could be identified in the hydrolyzed GML complex. Lower amounts of glucuronosyl and benzyl ether linkages were also observed after the hydrolysis. From the 2D-NMR spectra of the hydrolyzed complexes, it was concluded that the lignin in GML is less condensed than in XL due to its higher content in \beta-O-4\prime ether substructures (62&nbsp;% of side chains in GML vs 53&nbsp;% in XL) accompanied by more coniferyl alcohol end units (16 vs 13&nbsp;%). In contrast, the XL lignin has more pinoresinols (11 vs 6&nbsp;%) and dibenzodioxocins (9 vs 2&nbsp;%) than the GML (and both have ~13&nbsp;% phenylcoumarans and 1&nbsp;% spirodienones). Direct 2D-NMR analysis of the hydrolyzed GL complex was not possible due to its low solubility. However, after sample acetylation, an even less condensed lignin than in the GML complex was found (with up to 72&nbsp;% \beta-O-4\prime substructures and only 1&nbsp;% pinoresinols). The study provides evidence for the existence of structurally different lignins associated to hemicelluloses (xylan and glucomannan) and cellulose in spruce wood and, at the same time, offers information on some of the chemical linkages between the above polymers.;,citation_author=Xueyu Du;,citation_author=Marta Pérez-Boada;,citation_author=Carmen Fernández;,citation_author=Jorge Rencoret;,citation_author=José C.

The better news is that a mechanistic framework has emerged, wherein Small Auxin Up RNA (SAUR) proteins regulate protein phosphatases to control H+-ATPase activity.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=FERONIA receptor-like kinase regulates RHO GTPase signaling of root hair development;,citation_abstract=Plant RHO GTPases (RAC/ROPs) mediate multiple extracellular signals ranging from hormone to stress and regulate diverse cellular processes important for polarized cell growth, differentiation, development, reproduction, and responses to the environment. They shuttle between the GDP-bound inactive state and the GTP-bound activated state and their activation is predominantly mediated by a family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) referred to as ROPGEFs. Using the Arabidopsis ROPGEF1 as bait, we identified members of a receptor-like kinase (RLK) family as potential upstream regulators for RAC/ROP signaling. NADPH oxidase-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) are emerging as important regulators for growth and development and play a crucial role in mediating RAC/ROP-regulated root hair development, a polarized cell growth process. We therefore screened T-DNA insertion mutants in these RLKs for root hair defects and found that mutations in one of them, At3g51550 encoding the FERONIA (FER) receptor-like kinase, induced severe root hair defects. We show that the fer phenotypes correlated with reduced levels of active RAC/ROPs and NADPH oxidase-dependent, auxin-regulated ROS accumulation in roots and root hairs and that up-regulating RAC/ROP signaling in fer countered the mutant phenotypes. Taken together, these observations strongly support FER as an upstream regulator for the RAC/ROP-signaled pathway that controls ROS-mediated root hair development. Moreover, FER was pulled down by ROP2 GTPase in a guanine nucleotide-regulated manner implying a dynamic signaling complex involving FER, a ROPGEF, and a RAC/ROP.;,citation_author=Qiaohong Duan;,citation_author=Daniel Kita;,citation_author=Chao Li;,citation_author=Alice Y.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=FERONIA controls pectin- and nitric oxide-mediated male–female interaction;,citation_abstract=Species that propagate by sexual reproduction actively guard against the fertilization of an egg by multiple sperm (polyspermy). Flowering plants rely on pollen tubes to transport their immotile sperm to fertilize the female gametophytes inside ovules. In Arabidopsis, pollen tubes are guided by cysteine-rich chemoattractants to target the female gametophyte1,2. The FERONIA receptor kinase has a dual role in ensuring sperm delivery and blocking polyspermy3. It has previously been reported that FERONIA generates a female gametophyte environment that is required for sperm release4. Here we show that FERONIA controls several functionally linked conditions to prevent the penetration of female gametophytes by multiple pollen tubes in Arabidopsis. We demonstrate that FERONIA is crucial for maintaining de-esterified pectin at the filiform apparatus, a region of the cell wall at the entrance to the female gametophyte. Pollen tube arrival at the ovule triggers the accumulation of nitric oxide at the filiform apparatus in a process that is dependent on FERONIA and mediated by de-esterified pectin. Nitric oxide nitrosates both precursor and mature forms of the chemoattractant LURE11, respectively blocking its secretion and interaction with its receptor, to suppress pollen tube attraction. Our results elucidate a mechanism controlled by FERONIA in which the arrival of the first pollen tube alters ovular conditions to disengage pollen tube attraction and prevent the approach and penetration of the female gametophyte by late-arriving pollen tubes, thus averting polyspermy.;,citation_author=Qiaohong Duan;,citation_author=Ming-Che James Liu;,citation_author=Daniel Kita;,citation_author=Samuel S.

Here, we applied Structured Illumination Microscopy (SIM), which improves resolution two-fold over confocal or widefield imaging, to explore the dynamic behaviors of CESA particles in living plant cells. SIM imaging reveals that Arabidopsis thaliana CESA particles are more than twice as dense in the plasma membrane as previously estimated, helping explain the dense arrangement of cellulose observed in new wall layers. CESA particles tracked by SIM display minimal variation in velocity, suggesting coordinated control of CESA catalytic activity within single complexes and that CESA complexes might move steadily in tandem to generate larger cellulose fibrils or bundles. SIM data also reveal that CESA particles vary in their overlaps with microtubule tracks and can complete U-turns without changing speed. CESA track patterns can vary widely between neighboring cells of similar shape, implying that cellulose patterning is not the sole determinant of cellular growth anisotropy.

X-ray structural comparison of M502L and M502F mutants with the wild-type CotA shows that the geometry of the T1 copper site is maintained as well as the overall fold of the proteins. The replacement of the weak so-called axial ligand of the T1 site leads to an increase in the redox potential by approximately 100 mV relative to that of the wild-type enzyme (E0 =455 mV). However the M502L mutant exhibits a twofold to fourfold decrease in the kcat values for the all substrates tested and the catalytic activity in M502F is even more severely compromised; 10% activity and 0.15-0.05% for the non-phenolic substrates and for the phenolic substrates tested when compared with the wild-type enzyme. T1 copper depletion is a key event in the inactivation and thus it is a determinant of the thermodynamic stability of wild-type and mutant proteins. Whilst the unfolding of the tertiary structure in the wild-type enzyme is a two-state process displaying a midpoint at a guanidinium hydrochloride concentration of 4.6 M and a free-energy exchange in water of 10 kcal/mol, the unfolding for both mutant enzymes is clearly not a two-state process. At 1.9 M guanidinium hydrochloride, half of the molecules are in an intermediate conformation, only slightly less stable than the native state (approximately 1.4 kcal/mol).

The diversified functions of laccases, including the antagonistic ones such as their involvement in lignin biosynthesis (in plants) as well as lignin degradation (in fungi and bacteria), make them an interesting enzyme for study from the point of view of their structure, function and application. Important applications of laccases include delignification, pulp bleaching and bioremediation. The ability of laccases to polymerize natural phenols helps to develop new cosmetic pigments, hair dyeing materials, deodorants, toothpastes, mouthwashes and other useful products. Recently, the utility of enzyme has also been shown in the nanoparticle based biosensor technology as well as in medical fields. In the present review, a comparative account of the bacterial, fungal and plant laccases has been presented from these points of views. Laccases are dimeric or tetrameric glycoproteins usually containing four copper atoms per monomer. To perform catalytic function, laccase depends on Cu atoms that are distributed at the three different copper centers. These copper centers in laccases are categorized into three groups: Type-1 or blue copper center, Type-2 or normal copper and Type-3 or coupled binuclear copper centers. The four copper atoms are differing in their characteristic electronic paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signals. The phylogenetic analysis reveals, laccases from these groups (viz. bacteria, fungi and plant) form independent clades, in consistent with that of taxonomical classification. From previous experimental evidence and from in silico studies, it is evident that despite their wide taxonomic distribution and substrate diversity, molecular architecture of laccases is common to multicopper oxidases. Three dimensional structure predictions, at monomeric level, for all laccases (bacterial, fungal and plant) suggest that they are composed of three sequentially arranged cupredoxin-like domains. Multiple alignment of primary sequences of all three modeled laccases shows that, the copper binding motives are highly conserved in all sequences. The similarities are more significant in the N- and C-terminal regions, corresponding to Domains 1 and 3, as the copper interacting motif is present in Domains 1 and 3 not in Domain 2. This structural conservation reflects a common reaction mechanism for the copper oxidation and the O 2 reduction in these enzymes. Putative binding pocket analysis depicts, larger binding cavity for bacterial laccase as compared to those for plants and fungi. An in depth analysis of copper binding site, yielded significant differences in conserved residues for laccases of bacteria, fungi and plants which provided the basis for the dual and contrasting functions of laccases. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Among the events associated with this first major radiation of land plants is the evolution of tracheids, complex water–conducting cells defined by the presence of lignified secondary cell wall thickenings. Recent palaeobotanical analyses indicate that Early Devonian tracheids appear to possess secondary cell wall thickenings composed of two distinct layers: a degradation–prone layer adjacent to the primary cell wall and a degradation–resistant (possibly lignified) layer next to the cell lumen. In order to understand better the early evolution of tracheids, developmental and comparative studies of key basal (and potentially plesiomorphic) extant vascular plants have been initiated. Ultra–structural analysis and enzyme degradation studies of wall structure (to approximate diagenetic alterations of fossil tracheid structure) have been conducted on basal members of each of the two major clades of extant vascular plants: Huperzia (Lycophytina) and Equisetum (Euphyllophytina). This research demonstrates that secondary cell walls of extant basal vascular plants include a degradation–prone layer (“template layer”) and a degradation–resistant layer (“resistant layer”). This pattern of secondary cell wall formation in the water–conducting cells of extant vascular plants matches the pattern of wall thickenings in the tracheids of early fossil vascular plants and provides a key evolutionary link between tracheids of living vascular plants and those of their earliest fossil ancestors. Further studies of tracheid development and structure among basal extant vascular plants will lead to a more precise reconstruction of the early evolution of water–conducting tissues in land plants, and will add to the current limited knowledge of spatial, temporal and cytochemical aspects of cell wall formation in tracheary elements of vascular plants.;,citation_author=D.

Evidence has been obtained from a wide gamut of fossils including coalified compressions, silicified, pyritized and calcium carbonate perimineralizations. Most of the cells, only a few having been unequivocally demonstrated to be tracheidal, have walls with two layers, the inner sometimes broadly similar to annular, spiral and scalariform secondary thickenings of extant xylem. There are, however, very few cases of identical construction and the fossil representatives show greater complexity and variety. Their walls are presumed to have been lignified, but the polymer has not yet been directly identified in the fossils. The implications of these wall architectures on the functioning of the cells in water conduction are briefly considered, as is their relevance to hypotheses on inter-relationships of early tracheophytes and on tracheid ontogeny.;,citation_author=D.

The aims of the study were threefold: (1) to verify conclusions drawn from Nuclear Magnetic Resonance experiments previously performed on the same tissue samples, (2) to investigate degradation mechanisms and (3) to quantify the proportion of labeled material in each sample. Isotopic analysis of specific degradation products revealed the presence of the label exclusively within lignin-derived (phenolic) products and that the label is retained in its original position on the side-chain. These two results clearly indicate that there is no “scrambling” of carbon atoms as a result of thermal or chemical degradation, and thus lend strong support to analytical pyrolysis and chemolysis as viable approaches for structural investigations of the lignin macromolecule. Indeed, the isotopic enrichment of specific degradation products provides new evidence for certain types of linkages within the lignin polymer. The distribution and isotopic composition of the degradation products also strongly suggest an origin from newly-formed lignin as opposed to DHP-type products or unreacted substrate. As such, the data provides added confidence in the selective labeling approach for elucidation of the structure and biosynthesis of lignin. Isotopic mass balance calculations reveal that certain pyrolysis and CuO oxidation products show enhanced labeling which may be indicative of preferential incorporation of their specific precursors into the growing lignin macromolecule or heterogeneous lignin deposition.;,citation_author=T.

Samsun, whereas in plasma membrane (pm) vesicles prepared from leaves, protease activity was at the detection limit. Biochemical characterisation revealed a high diversity of particular hydrophobic pm-proteases indicating multiple functions in root tissue. One proportion of chromatographically separated proteases was split up by non-reducing SDS-PAGE in 8-12 single polypeptides, dependent on plant nitrogen nutrition. The active polypeptides could be grouped in those that were (i) inhibited, (ii) stimulated and (iii) independent of bivalent cations. Although, the total specific protease activity of various pm vesicles was almost identical, the composition and activity of individual polypeptides was dependent on nitrogen supply of the plants. Particularly, nitrogen deficiency stimulated the activity of high molecular mass proteases (125 kDa-97 kDa), whereas sufficient nitrate supply enhanced proteolytic activity of 90 kDa, 83 kDa and 65 kDa polypeptides. Endogenous proteolysis within pm vesicles suggested that at least partly protease substrates are localised within the same membrane. A comparison of polypeptides originated from proteolysis of pm vesicles and those exudated by roots into the external medium points to a role of root pm-proteases in the specific release of polypeptides into the rhizosphere. © 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Endomembrane system function critically depends on the ability of the cell to (1) define compartment and pathway identity, and (2) organise compartments and pathways dynamically in space and time. Eukaryotes possess a complex molecular machinery to control these processes, including small GTPases and their regulators, SNAREs, tethering factors, motor proteins, and cytoskeletal elements. Whereas many of the core components of the eukaryotic endomembrane system are broadly conserved, there have been substantial diversifications within different lineages, possibly reflecting lineage-specific requirements of endomembrane trafficking. This Review focusses on the spatio-temporal regulation of post-Golgi exocytic transport in plants. It highlights recent advances in our understanding of the elaborate network of pathways transporting different cargoes to different domains of the cell surface, and the molecular machinery underpinning them (with a focus on Rab GTPases, their interactors and the cytoskeleton).

A recent structural characterization of cell walls from monocot species showed that the flavone tricin is part of the native lignin polymer, where it is hypothesized to initiate lignin chains. In this study, we investigated the consequences of altered tricin levels on lignin structure and cell wall recalcitrance by phenolic profiling, nuclear magnetic resonance, and saccharification assays of the naturally silenced maize (Zea mays) C2-Idf (inhibitor diffuse) mutant, defective in the CHALCONE SYNTHASE Colorless2 (C2) gene. We show that the C2-Idf mutant produces highly reduced levels of apigenin- and tricin-related flavonoids, resulting in a strongly reduced incorporation of tricin into the lignin polymer. Moreover, the lignin was enriched in \beta-\beta and \beta-5 units, lending support to the contention that tricin acts to initiate lignin chains and that, in the absence of tricin, more monolignol dimerization reactions occur. In addition, the C2-Idf mutation resulted in strikingly higher Klason lignin levels in the leaves. As a consequence, the leaves of C2-Idf mutants had significantly reduced saccharification efficiencies compared with those of control plants.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A novel extracytoplasmic phenol oxidase of Streptomyces: Its possible involvement in the onset of morphogenesis;,citation_abstract=Exogenous addition of copper stimulates cellular differentiation in Streptomyces spp. Several lines of evidence suggested a parallel correlation between the stimulatory effect of copper and phenol-oxidizing enzyme activities in Streptomyces griseus. Here a novel extracytoplasmic phenol oxidase (EpoA) associated with cellular development of this organism was identified and characterized. EpoA activity, examined by an in-gel stain procedure with N,N’-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine sulfate as a substrate, was repressed by glucose and induced by copper supplied in the medium. The enzyme activity was abolished and markedly reduced in the mutants for A-factor biosynthesis and amfR, respectively, which suggested that the activity of the enzyme depends on those essential regulators for morphogenesis in S. griseus. EpoA protein was purified to homogeneity and the N-terminal amino acid sequence was determined. A homologous sequence identified in the genomic database of Streptomyces coelicolorA3(2) was used as a probe to clone the complete epoA gene of S. griseus. The deduced amino acid sequence of EpoA revealed that the mature protein with a molecular mass of 34 kDa was preceded by a signal peptide consisting of 34 aa, consistent with EpoA being a secreted enzyme. EpoA was predicted to be a laccase-type oxidase by not only the sequence similarity, but its substrate selectivity, oxidizing not tyrosine but dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) to generate melanin pigment. Introduction of epoA on a plasmid partially restored both the EpoA activity and aerial mycelium productivity in an A-factor-deficient mutant. Exogenous supplementation of a substance synthesized by purified EpoA from DOPA stimulated cellular differentiation in S. griseus and several other species.

Although the system has proven to be valuable, its utility is diminished by the lack of an efficient transformation protocol. We herein present a novel method to introduce DNA/RNA efficiently into Zinnia cells by electroporation-based transient transformation. Using reporter gene plasmids, we optimized the system for efficiency of transformation and ability for the transformed cells to transdifferentiate into TEs. Optimal conditions included a partial digestion of the cell walls by pectolyase, a low voltage and high capacitance electrical pulse and an optimal medium to maintain cell viability during transformation. Beyond the simple expression of a reporter protein in Zinnia cells, we extended our protocol to subcellular protein targeting, simultaneous co-expression of several reporter proteins and promoter-activity monitoring during TE differentiation. Most importantly, we tested the system for double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-induced RNA silencing. By introducing in vitro-synthesized dsRNAs, we were able to phenocopy the Arabidopsis cellulose synthase (CesA) mutants that had defects in secondary cell-wall synthesis. Suppressing the expression ofZinnia CesA homologues resulted in an increase of abnormal TEs with aberrant secondary walls.

In this study we provide evidence that activity of the enolase ENO2 is essential for the growth and development of plants. We show that arabidopsis plants with compromised ENO2 function, that were generated by mutating the LOS2/ENO2 locus, have severe cellular defects including reduced cell size and defective cell differentiation with restricted lignification. At the tissue and organ level LOS2/ENO2-deficient plants are characterized by reduced growth of shoots and roots, altered vascular development and defective secondary growth of stems, impaired floral organogenesis and defective male gametophyte function resulting in embryo lethality, as well as delayed senescence. These phenotypes correlate with reduced lignin and increased salicylic acid contents as well as altered fatty acid and soluble sugar composition. In addition to an enolase the LOS2/ENO2 locus encodes the transcription factor AtMBP-1 and here we reveal that this bi-functionality serves to maintain homeostasis of ENO2 activity. In summary, we show that in plants enolase function is required for formation of chorismate-dependent secondary metabolites and that this activity is feedback-inhibited by AtMBP-1 to enable normal development and reproductive success of plants.

Our approach consisted of using Arabidopsis thaliana cell cultures capable of differentiating into two different cell types: vascular tracheary elements (TEs) that undergo programmed cell death (PCD) and protoplast autolysis, and parenchymatic non-TEs that remain alive. The TE cell type displayed higher levels of autophagy when expression of the TE-specific METACASPASE9 (MC9) was reduced using RNAi (MC9-RNAi). Misregulation of autophagy in the MC9-RNAi TEs coincided with ectopic death of the non-TEs, implying the existence of an autophagy-dependent intercellular signalling from within the TEs towards the non-TEs. Viability of the non-TEs was restored when AUTOPHAGY2 (ATG2) was downregulated specifically in MC9-RNAi TEs, demonstrating the importance of autophagy in the spatial confinement of cell death.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A collection of genetically engineered &amp;amp;amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Populus&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; trees reveals wood biomass traits that predict glucose yield from enzymatic hydrolysis;,citation_abstract=Wood represents a promising source of sugars to produce bio-based renewables, including biofuels. However, breaking down lignocellulose requires costly pretreatments because lignocellulose is recalcitrant to enzymatic saccharification. Increasing saccharification potential would greatly contribute to make wood a competitive alternative to petroleum, but this requires improving wood properties. To identify wood biomass traits associated with saccharification, we analyzed a total of 65 traits related to wood chemistry, anatomy and structure, biomass production and saccharification in 40 genetically engineered Populus tree lines. These lines exhibited broad variation in quantitative traits, allowing for multivariate analyses and mathematical modeling. Modeling revealed that seven wood biomass traits associated in a predictive manner with saccharification of glucose after pretreatment. Four of these seven traits were also negatively associated with biomass production, suggesting a trade-off between saccharification potential and total biomass, which has previously been observed to offset the overall sugar yield from whole trees. We therefore estimated the “total-wood glucose yield” (TWG) from whole trees and found 22 biomass traits predictive of TWG after pretreatment. Both saccharification and TWG were associated with low abundant, often overlooked matrix polysaccharides such as arabinose and rhamnose which possibly represent new markers for improved Populus feedstocks.;,citation_author=Sacha Escamez;,citation_author=Madhavi Latha Gandla;,citation_author=Marta Derba-Maceluch;,citation_author=Sven-Olof Lundqvist;,citation_author=Ewa J.

Theoretical physics predicts that the fluorescence lifetime of these polymers is related to their chemical composition. We verified this prediction for lignin, a major structural element in plant cell walls that form woody biomass. Lignin is composed of different phenylpropanoid units, and its composition affects its properties, biological functions, and the utilization of wood biomass. We carried out fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) measurements of wood cell wall lignin in a population of 90 hybrid aspen trees genetically engineered to display differences in cell wall chemistry and structure. We also measured the wood cell wall composition by classical analytical methods in these trees. Using statistical modeling and machine learning algorithms, we identified parameters of fluorescence lifetime that predict the content of S-type and G-type lignin units, the two main types of units in the lignin of angiosperm (flowering) plants. In a first step toward tailoring lignin biosynthesis toward improvement of woody biomass feedstocks, we show how FLIM can reveal the dynamics of lignin biosynthesis in two different biological contexts, including in vivo while lignin is being synthesized in the walls of living cells.;,citation_author=Sacha Escamez;,citation_author=Christine Terryn;,citation_author=Madhavi Latha Gandla;,citation_author=Zakiya Yassin;,citation_author=Gerhard Scheepers;,citation_author=Torgny Näsholm;,citation_author=Ola Sundman;,citation_author=Leif J.

Exudates from M. javanica roots were sampled at root penetration (early) and gall development (late). EMM indicated that late root exudates from M. javanica treatments contained more aromatic amino acid compounds than the rest (control, P. chlamydosporia or P. chlamydosporia and M. javanica). 1H NMR showed that organic acids (acetate, lactate, malate, succinate and formic acid) and one unassigned aromatic compound (peak no. 22) were the most relevant metabolites in root exudates. Robust principal component analysis (PCA) grouped early exudates for nematode (PC1) or fungus presence (PC3). PCA found (PC1, 73.31 %) increased acetate and reduced lactate and an unassigned peak no. 22 characteristic of M. javanica root exudates resulting from nematode invasion and feeding. An increase of peak no. 22 (PC3, 4.82 %) characteristic of P. chlamydosporia exudates could be a plant &amp;amp;amp;quot;primer&amp;quot; defence. In late ones in PC3 (8.73 %) the presence of the nematode grouped the samples. HPLC-MS determined rhizosphere fingerprints of 16 (early) and 25 (late exudates) m/z signals, respectively. Late signals were exclusive from M. javanica exudates confirming EEM and 1H NMR results. A 235 m/z signal reduced in M. javanica root exudates (early and late) could be a repressed plant defense.

The method is based on the coupling reaction between the nucleophile 3-methyl-2-benzothiazolinone hydrazone (MBTH) and the quinone products of the oxidation of monophenols and o-diphenols in the presence of polyphenol oxidase. MBTH?quinone adduct is further oxidized by another molecule of o-quinone. Different o-diphenols were assayed:? l-dopa, dopamine, catechol, 4-methylcatechol, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DHPAA), and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylpropionic acid (DHPPA) (and their corresponding monophenols). The PHPPA (p-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid)/DHPPA pair was chosen as the best pair from those assayed thanks to its kinetic features, molar absorptivity (\varepsilon), and solubility. All the MBTH?o-quinone adducts from the above substrates evolved at pH 6.8. A reaction mechanism for explaining the evolution of the MBTH?o-quinone adduct of DHPPA has been proposed and kinetically studied for the first time. The wavelength where the MBTH?o-quinone adduct of DHPPA showed an isosbestic point (?i = 466 nm) was chosen for spectrophotometrically recording the action of PPO on the PHPPA/DHPPA pair. This method could be useful for determining microquantities of PPO in problem samples.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Spring Sap of Trees;,citation_abstract=In the spring, sap in perennial plants becomes available after winter dormancy. As is well known, substances including minerals and organic nutrients are transported from storage compartments in roots and stems to growth regions. For this solute distribution, xylem as well as phloem are used and probably also the cambial region and the ray system. In the present study, a puncture method has been used to record sap availability in six north European tree species during the spring. Attempts were made to withdraw sap from the trees at points 0.5 m, 1.3 m and 3.0 m above ground with “phloem needles” (constructed according to Hammel 1968), and a syringe. Sap could be withdrawn for the longest period for the sycamore (71 days). Birch (47 days) gave an intermediate period, beech (12 days), oak (12 days) and alder (13 days) gave short periods, and sap could not be withdrawn from ash. Effects of two environmental factors, temperature and light intensity on sap availability were examined. Temperature dependence of sap availability, already observed in the genus Acer, was confirmed in sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus). There also seemed to be a correlation between sap availability and light intensity. Analysis of sugar in the tree sap revealed that sucrose was the only sugar in the sap of sycamore but hexoses (glucose and fructose) were preponderant in the sap of the other trees. The pH of sycamore sap (pH 6.9–5.4) fell as the season advanced. However, the pH-values of sap from the other trees did not vary significantly.;,citation_author=Samuel K.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Expression of a bacterial 3-dehydroshikimate dehydratase reduces lignin content and improves biomass saccharification efficiency;,citation_abstract=Lignin confers recalcitrance to plant biomass used as feedstocks in agro-processing industries or as source of renewable sugars for the production of bioproducts. The metabolic steps for the synthesis of lignin building blocks belong to the shikimate and phenylpropanoid pathways. Genetic engineering efforts to reduce lignin content typically employ gene knockout or gene silencing techniques to constitutively repress one of these metabolic pathways. Recently, new strategies have emerged offering better spatiotemporal control of lignin deposition, including the expression of enzymes that interfere with the normal process for cell wall lignification. In this study, we report that expression of a 3-dehydroshikimate dehydratase (QsuB from Corynebacterium glutamicum) reduces lignin deposition in Arabidopsis cell walls. QsuB was targeted to the plastids to convert 3-dehydroshikimate - an intermediate of the shikimate pathway - into protocatechuate. Compared to wild-type plants, lines expressing QsuB contain higher amounts of protocatechuate, p-coumarate, p-coumaraldehyde and p-coumaryl alcohol, and lower amounts of coniferaldehyde, coniferyl alcohol, sinapaldehyde and sinapyl alcohol. 2D-NMR spectroscopy and pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (pyro-GC/MS) reveal an increase of p-hydroxyphenyl units and a reduction of guaiacyl units in the lignin of QsuB lines. Size-exclusion chromatography indicates a lower degree of lignin polymerization in the transgenic lines. Therefore, our data show that the expression of QsuB primarily affects the lignin biosynthetic pathway. Finally, biomass from these lines exhibits more than a twofold improvement in saccharification efficiency. We conclude that the expression of QsuB in plants, in combination with specific promoters, is a promising gain-of-function strategy for spatiotemporal reduction of lignin in plant biomass.;,citation_author=Aymerick Eudes;,citation_author=Noppadon Sathitsuksanoh;,citation_author=Edward E.

We tested the hypothesis that these ecological differences were reflected in higher nitrogen (N) use efficiency in HA than in BC and that HA would allocate more resources belowground than BC in the presence of high and low N availability. We expected that responses of wood properties to elevated N would be more pronounced in the species with higher wood formation in response to N supply. HA showed higher belowground biomass partitioning than BC in the presence of low (0.2 mM) and high (2 mM) N supply, but in contrast to our expectation whole-plant nitrogen use efficiency and the stem carbon-to-nitrogen balance were lower than in BC. In response to elevated N, HA exhibited stronger stimulation of biomass production than BC, especially of the stem, which showed significant increases in biomass and volume but decreases in density. Lignification, especially the production of guaiacyl (G)-compared to syringyl (S)-lignin, was delayed in HA compared with BC wood. Since G lignin leads to stronger crosslinking than S lignin, its delayed formation may have enabled stronger expansion and higher volume increment of HA than of BC stems. Our results suggest that BC, a poplar species adapted to fluctuating N supply, is less responsive to differences in N availability than aspen that occurs in low N environments.;,citation_author=Dejuan Euring;,citation_author=Christian Löfke;,citation_author=Thomas Teichmann;,citation_author=Andrea Polle;,citation_publication_date=2012;,citation_cover_date=2012;,citation_year=2012;,citation_issue=6;,citation_doi=10.1007/s00468-012-0761-0;,citation_isbn=0931-1890;,citation_issn=09311890;,citation_volume=26;,citation_journal_title=Trees - Struct.

On a benchmark dataset of 17 heterodimer proteins without templates (introduced in [2]) we achieve at least medium accuracy (DockQ [3] \geq 0.49) on 14 targets and high accuracy (DockQ \geq 0.8) on 6 targets, compared to 9 targets of at least medium accuracy and 4 of high accuracy for the previous state of the art system (an AlphaFold-based system from [2]). We also predict structures for a large dataset of 4,433 recent protein complexes, from which we score all non-redundant interfaces with low template identity. For heteromeric interfaces we successfully predict the interface (DockQ \geq 0.23) in 67% of cases, and produce high accuracy predictions (DockQ \geq 0.8) in 23% of cases, an improvement of +25 and +11 percentage points over the flexible linker modification of AlphaFold [4] respectively.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Bacterial tyrosinases and their applications;,citation_abstract=Tyrosinases with different physico-chemical properties have been identified from various bacterial phyla such as Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria and their production is often inducible by environmental stresses. Tyrosinases are enzymes catalysing the oxidation of mono- and di-phenolic compounds to corresponding quinones with the concomitant reduction of molecular oxygen to water. Since the quinone produced can further react non-enzymatically with other nucleophiles, e.g. amino groups, many tyrosinases have a recorded cross-linking activity on proteins. Various bacterial tyrosinases oxidise tyrosine, catechol, l/d-DOPA, caffeic acid and polyphenolic substrates such as catechins. This substrate specificity has been exploited to engineer biosensors able to detect even minimal amounts of different phenolic compounds. The physiological role of tyrosinases in the biosynthesis of melanins has been used for the production of coloured and dyeing agents. Moreover, the cross-linking activity of tyrosinases has found application in food processing and in the functionalisation of materials. Numerous tyrosinases with varying substrate specificities and stability features have been isolated from bacteria and they can constitute valuable alternatives to the well-studied tyrosinase from common mushroom.;,citation_author=Greta Faccio;,citation_author=Kristiina Kruus;,citation_author=Markku Saloheimo;,citation_author=Linda Thöny-Meyer;,citation_publication_date=2012-12;,citation_cover_date=2012-12;,citation_year=2012;,citation_issue=12;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.procbio.2012.08.018;,citation_issn=1359-5113;,citation_volume=47;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Process Biochem.;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=An Intracellular Laccase is Responsible for the Epicatechin Mediated Anthocyanin Degradation in Litchi Fruit Pericarp;,citation_abstract=In contrast to the detailed molecular knowledge available on anthocyanin synthesis, little is known about its catabolism in plants. Litchi (Litchi chinensis) fruit lose their attractive red color soon after harvest. The mechanism leading to quick degradation of anthocyanins in the pericarp is not well understood. An anthocyanin degradation enzyme (ADE) was purified to homogeneity by sequential column chromatography, using partially purified anthocyanins from litchi pericarp as a substrate. The purified ADE, of 116 kD by urea SDS-PAGE, was identified as a laccase (ADE/LAC). The full-length complementary DNA encoding ADE/LAC was obtained, and a polyclonal antibody raised against a deduced peptide of the gene recognized theADE protein. The anthocyanin degradation function of the gene was confirmed by its transient expression in tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) leaves. The highest ADE/LAC transcript abundance was in the pericarp in comparison with other tissues, and was about 1,000-fold higher than the polyphenol oxidase gene in the pericarp. Epicatechin was found to be the favorable substrate for the ADE/LAC. The dependence of anthocyanin degradation by the enzyme on the presence of epicatechin suggests an ADE/LAC epicatechin-coupled oxidation model.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A Transcriptomic Analysis of Xylan Mutants Does Not Support the Existence of a Secondary Cell Wall Integrity System in Arabidopsis;,citation_abstract=Yeast have long been known to possess a cell wall integrity (CWI) system, and recently an analogous system has been described for the primary walls of plants (PCWI) that leads to changes in plant growth and cell wall composition. A similar system has been proposed to exist for secondary cell walls (SCWI). However, there is little data to support this. Here, we analyzed the stem transcriptome of a set of cell wall biosynthetic mutants in order to investigate whether cell wall damage, in this case caused by aberrant xylan synthesis, activates a signaling cascade or changes in cell wall synthesis gene expression. Our data revealed remarkably few changes to the transcriptome. We hypothesize that this is because cells undergoing secondary cell wall thickening have entered a committed programme leading to cell death, and therefore a SCWI system would have limited impact. The absence of transcriptomic responses to secondary cell wall alterations may facilitate engineering of the secondary cell wall of plants.;,citation_author=Nuno Faria-Blanc;,citation_author=Jenny C.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Programmed cell death controlled by ANAC033/SOMBRERO determines root cap organ size in arabidopsis;,citation_abstract=Background The root cap is a plant organ that ensheathes the meristematic stem cells at the root tip. Unlike other plant organs, the root cap shows a rapid cellular turnover, balancing constant cell generation by specific stem cells with the disposal of differentiated cells at the root cap edge. This cellular turnover is critical for the maintenance of root cap size and its position around the growing root tip, but how this is achieved and controlled in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana remains subject to contradictory hypotheses. Results Here, we show that a highly organized cell death program is the final step of lateral root cap differentiation and that preparation for cell death is transcriptionally controlled by ANAC033/SOMBRERO. Precise timing of cell death is critical for the elimination of root cap cells before they fully enter the root elongation zone, which in turn is important in order to allow optimal root growth. Root cap cell death is followed by a rapid cell-autonomous corpse clearance and DNA fragmentation dependent on the S1-P1 type nuclease BFN1. Conclusions Based on these results, we propose a novel concept in plant development that recognizes programmed cell death as a mechanism for maintaining organ size and tissue homeostasis in the Arabidopsis root cap. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.;,citation_author=Matyáš Fendrych;,citation_author=Tom Van Hautegem;,citation_author=Matthias Van Durme;,citation_author=Yadira Olvera-Carrillo;,citation_author=Marlies Huysmans;,citation_author=Mansour Karimi;,citation_author=Saskia Lippens;,citation_author=Christopher J.

We have used a knock-out mutant of AtPrx4, the closest homologue to ZePrx, to study the involvement of this basic peroxidase in the physiology of the plant under both long- and short-day light conditions. Our results suggest that AtPrx4 is involved in cell wall lignification, especially in syringyl monomer formation. The disruption of AtPrx4 causes a decrease in syringyl units proportion, but only when light conditions are optimal. Moreover, the effect of AtPrx4 disruption is age-dependent, and it is only significant when the elongation process of the stem has ceased and lignification becomes active. In conclusion, AtPrx4 emerges as a basic peroxidase regulated by day length with an important role in lignification.;,citation_author=Francisco Fernández-Pérez;,citation_author=Tamara Vivar;,citation_author=Federico Pomar;,citation_author=María A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The suppression of AtPrx52 affects fibers but not xylem lignification in Arabidopsis by altering the proportion of syringyl units;,citation_abstract=Lignins result from the oxidative polymerization of three hydroxycinnamyl (p-coumaryl, coniferyl and sinapyl) alcohols in a reaction mediated by peroxidases (EC 1.11.1.7) and laccases (EC 1.10.3.2), yielding H, G and S units, respectively. Although both acidic and basic peroxidases can oxidize p-coumaryl and coniferyl alcohol, only basic peroxidases are able to oxidize sinapyl alcohol. The AtPrx52 from Arabidopsis is a basic peroxidase that has been reported to be highly homologous to the basic peroxidase of Zinnia elegans, the only peroxidase which has been unequivocally linked to lignin formation. Here, we show how the suppression of AtPrx52 causes a change in lignin composition, mainly at the level of stem interfascicular fibers. Quantification of lignins in two different atprx52 knock-out mutants revealed a decrease of lignin amount compared with wild type. The S/G ratio, obtained by both nitrobenzene oxidation and thioacidolysis, indicated a decrease in S units in the atprx52 mutants. As deduced from Wiesner and mainly Mäule staining, this reduction in S unit content appears to be restricted to the interfascicular fibers. Moreover, quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis in atprx52 plants showed a general downregulation of genes involved in lignin biosynthetic pathway, as well as genes related to secondary cell wall. On the other hand, other routes from phenylpropanoid metabolism were induced. Taken together, our results indicate that AtPrx52 is involved in the synthesis of S units in interfascicular fibers at late stages of the lignification process.;,citation_author=Francisco Fernández-Pérez;,citation_author=Federico Pomar;,citation_author=María A.

Here we describe the folding and maturation of human tyrosinase (TYR) using an in vitro translation system coupled with ER-derived microsomes or with semipermeabilized cells, as an intact ER source. TYR remained misfolded as determined by its sensitivity to trypsin digestion and its persistent interaction with the ER resident lectin chaperones calnexin and calreticulin when produced in ER-derived microsomes or nonmelanocytic semipermeabilized cells. However, when TYR was translocated into semipermeabilized melanocytes, chaperone interactions were transient, maturation progressed to a trypsin-resistant state, and a TYR homodimer was formed. The use of semipermeabilized mouse melanocytes defective for tyrosinase or other melanocyte-specific proteins as the ER source indicated that proper TYR maturation and oligomerization were greatly aided by the presence of wild type tyrosinase and tyrosinase-related protein 1.

Thus, they are tightly associated to cell wall loosening and stiffening. They are members of large multigenic families, mostly due to an elevated rate of gene duplication in higher plants, resulting in a high risk of functional redundancy between them. However, proteomic and (micro)transcriptomic analyses have shown that CIII Prx expression profiles are highly specific. Based on these omic analyses, several reverse genetic studies have demonstrated the importance of the spatio-temporal regulation of their expression and ability to interact with cell wall microdomains in order to achieve specific activity in vivo.

The outline of this work is focused on the determination of catalytic and bioelectrochemical properties of these four enzymes in homogenous solution as well as immobilized onto electrode surface in the presence of a set of different redox mediators. The results measured in the homogenous reaction system correlated well with those measured with the immobilized enzymes. In addition, they are in good agreement with those reported with reference techniques, suggesting that the electrochemical methods employed in this work can be applied well in place of the traditional techniques commonly used for the kinetic characterization of laccases. These results are also discussed in terms of the known amino acid sequences and three-dimensional (3D) structures of the laccases.;,citation_author=Marco Frasconi;,citation_author=Gabriele Favero;,citation_author=Harry Boer;,citation_author=Anu Koivula;,citation_author=Franco Mazzei;,citation_publication_date=2010;,citation_cover_date=2010;,citation_year=2010;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.bbapap.2009.12.018;,citation_isbn=1570-9639;,citation_issn=0006-3002;,citation_pmid=20056172;,citation_volume=1804;,citation_journal_title=Biochim.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Emission of methane, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and short-chain hydrocarbons from vegetation foliage under ultraviolet irradiation;,citation_abstract=The original report that plants emit methane (CH4 ) under aerobic conditions caused much debate and controversy. Critics questioned experimental techniques, possible mechanisms for CH4 production and the nature of estimating global emissions. Several studies have now confirmed that aerobic CH4 emissions can be detected from plant foliage but the extent of the phenomenon in plants and the precise mechanisms and precursors involved remain uncertain. In this study we investigated the role of environmentally realistic levels of ultraviolet (UV) radiation in causing the emission of CH4 and other gases from foliage obtained from a wide variety of plant types. We related our measured emissions to the foliar content of methyl (Me) esters and lignin and to the epidermal UV absorbance of the species investigated. Our data demonstrate that the terrestrial vegetation foliage sampled did emit CH4 , with a range in emissions of 0.6-31.8 ng CH4 g(-1) leaf DW h(-1) , which compares favourably with the original reports of experimental work. In addition to CH4 emissions, our data show that carbon monoxide, ethene, and propane are also emitted under UV stress but we detected no significant emissions of carbon dioxide or ethane.;,citation_author=Wesley T.

Auxin movement between cells depends on AUX1/LAX, PGP and PIN protein families that mediate auxin transport across the plasma membrane. The directionality of auxin flow within tissues is largely determined by polar, subcellular localization of PIN auxin efflux carriers. PIN proteins undergo rapid subcellular dynamics that is important for the process of auxin transport and its directionality. Furthermore, various environmental and endogenous signals can modulate trafficking and polarity of PIN proteins and by this mechanism change auxin distribution.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Lignin distribution in wood cell walls determined by TEM and backscattered SEM techniques;,citation_abstract=The lignin distribution in cell walls of spruce and beech wood was determined by high-voltage transmission-electron-microscopy (TEM) in sections stained with potassium permanganate as well as by field-emission-scanning-electron-microscopy (FE-SEM) combined with a back-scattered electron detector on mercurized specimens. The latter is a new technique based on the mercurization of lignin and the concomitant visualization of mercury by back-scattered electron microscopy (BSE). Due to this combination it was possible to obtain a visualized overview of the lignin distribution across the different layers of the cell wall. To our knowledge, this combined method was used the first time to analyse the lignin distribution in cell walls. In agreement with previous work the highest lignin levels were found in the compound middle lamella and the cell corners. Back-scattered FE-SEM allows the lignin distribution in the pit membrane of bordered pits as well as in the various cell wall layers to be shown. In addition, by using TEM as well as SEM we observed that lignin closely follows the cellulose microfibril orientation in the secondary cell wall. From these observations, we conclude that the polymerisation of monolignols is affected by the arrangement of the polysaccharides which constitute the cell wall. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

The cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) gene encodes a key enzyme which catalyzes the last step of lignin monomer biosynthesis. Transgenic switchgrass plants were produced with a CAD RNAi gene construct under the control of the maize ubiquitin promoter. The transgenic lines showed reduced CAD expression levels, reduced enzyme activities, reduced lignin content, and altered lignin composition. The modification of lignin biosynthesis resulted in improved sugar release and forage digestibility. Significant increases of saccharification efficiency were obtained in most of the transgenic lines with or without acid pretreatment. A negative correlation between lignin content and sugar release was found among these transgenic switchgrass lines.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Methionine Sulfoxide Reductase A (MsrA) and Its Function in Ubiquitin-Like Protein Modification in Archaea;,citation_abstract=Methionine sulfoxide reductase A (MsrA) is an antioxidant enzyme found in all domains of life that catalyzes the reduction of methionine-S-sulfoxide (MSO) to methionine in proteins and free amino acids. We demonstrate that archaeal MsrA has a ubiquitin-like (Ubl) protein modification activity that is distinct from its stereospecific reduction of MSO residues. MsrA catalyzes this Ubl modification activity, with the Ubl-activating E1 UbaA, in the presence of the mild oxidant dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and in the absence of reductant. In contrast, the MSO reductase activity of MsrA is inhibited by DMSO and requires reductant. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis reveals that MsrA-dependent Ubl conjugates are associated with DNA replication, protein remodeling, and oxidative stress and include the Ubl-modified MsrA, Orc3 (Orc1/Cdc6), and Cdc48d (Cdc48/p97 AAA+ ATPase). Overall, we found archaeal MsrA to have opposing MSO reductase and Ubl modifying activities that are associated with oxidative stress responses and controlled by exposure to mild oxidant. IMPORTANCE Proteins that are damaged by oxidative stress are often targeted for proteolysis by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). The mechanisms that control this response are poorly understood, especially under conditions of mild oxidative stress when protein damage is modest. Here, we discovered a novel function of archaeal MsrA in guiding the Ubl modification of target proteins in the presence of mild oxidant. This newly reported activity of MsrA is distinct from its stereospecific reduction of methionine-S-sulfoxide to methionine residues.

In this study, we provide the crystal structures of Aspergillus oryzae full-length pro-tyrosinase in the holo- and the apo-forms at 1.39 and 2.05 Å resolution, respectively, revealing that Phe(513) on the C-terminal domain is accommodated in the substrate-binding site as a substrate analog to protect the dicopper active site from substrate access (proteolytic cleavage of the C-terminal domain or deformation of the C-terminal domain by acid treatment transforms the pro-tyrosinase to the active enzyme (Fujieda, N., Murata, M., Yabuta, S., Ikeda, T., Shimokawa, C., Nakamura, Y., Hata, Y., and Itoh, S.

Detailed crystallographic analysis and structure-based mutational studies have shown that the copper incorporation into the active site is governed by three cysteines as follows: Cys(92), which is covalently bound to His(94) via an unusual thioether linkage in the holo-form, and Cys(522) and Cys(525) of the CXXC motif located on the C-terminal domain.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase and 4-Kinase Have Distinct Roles in Intracellular Trafficking of Cellulose Synthase Complexes in Arabidopsis thaliana;,citation_abstract=The oriented deposition of cellulose microfibrils in the plant cell wall plays a crucial role in various plant functions such as cell growth, organ formation and defense responses. Cellulose is synthesized by cellulose synthase complexes (CSCs) embedded in the plasma membrane (PM), which comprise the cellulose synthases (CESAs). The abundance and localization of CSCs at the PM should be strictly controlled for precise regulation of cellulose deposition, which strongly depends on the membrane trafficking system. However, the mechanism of the intracellular transport of CSCs is still poorly understood. In this study, we explored requirements for phosphoinositides (PIs) in CESA trafficking by analyzing the effects of inhibitors of PI synthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana expressing green fluorescent protein-tagged CESA3 (GFP–CESA3). We found that a shift to a sucrose-free condition accelerated re-localization of PM-localized GFP–CESA3 into the periphery of the Golgi apparatus via the clathrin-enriched trans-Golgi network (TGN). Treatment with wortmannin (Wm), an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3- (PI3K) and 4- (PI4K) kinases, and phenylarsine oxide (PAO), a more specific inhibitor for PI4K, inhibited internalization of GFP–CESA3 from the PM. In contrast, treatment with LY294002, which impairs the PI3K activity, did not exert such an inhibitory effect on the sequestration of GFP–CESA3, but caused a predominant accumulation of GFP–CESA3 at the ring-shaped periphery of the Golgi apparatus, resulting in the removal of GFP–CESA3 from the PM. These results indicate that PIs are essential elements for localization and intracellular transport of CESA3 and that PI4K and PI3K are required for distinct steps in secretory and/or endocytic trafficking of CESA3.;,citation_author=Masaru Fujimoto;,citation_author=Yasuyuki Suda;,citation_author=Samantha Vernhettes;,citation_author=Akihiko Nakano;,citation_author=Takashi Ueda;,citation_publication_date=2015-02;,citation_cover_date=2015-02;,citation_year=2015;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1093/pcp/pcu195;,citation_issn=0032-0781;,citation_volume=56;,citation_journal_title=Plant Cell Physiol.;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Cortical microtubules optimize cell-wall crystallinity to drive unidirectional growth in Arabidopsis;,citation_abstract=The shape of plants depends on cellulose, a biopolymer that self-assembles into crystalline, inextensible microfibrils (CMFs) upon synthesis at the plasma membrane by multi-enzyme cellulose synthase complexes (CSCs). CSCs are displaced in directions predicted by underlying parallel arrays of cortical microtubules, but CMFs remain transverse in cells that have lost the ability to expand unidirectionally as a result of disrupted microtubules. These conflicting findings suggest that microtubules are important for some physico-chemical property of cellulose that maintains wall integrity. Using X-ray diffraction, we demonstrate that abundant microtubules enable a decrease in the degree of wall crystallinity during rapid growth at high temperatures. Reduced microtubule polymer mass in the mor1-1 mutant at high temperatures is associated with failure of crystallinity to decrease and a loss of unidirectional expansion. Promotion of microtubule bundling by over-expressing the RIC1 microtubule-associated protein reduced the degree of crystallinity. Using live-cell imaging, we detected an increase in the proportion of CSCs that track in microtubule-free domains in mor1-1, and an increase in the CSC velocity. These results suggest that microtubule domains affect glucan chain crystallization during unidirectional cell expansion. Microtubule disruption had no obvious effect on the orientation of CMFs in dark-grown hypocotyl cells. CMFs at the outer face of the hypocotyl epidermal cells had highly variable orientation, in contrast to the transverse CMFs on the radial and inner periclinal walls. This suggests that the outer epidermal mechanical properties are relatively isotropic, and that axial expansion is largely dependent on the inner tissue layers.;,citation_author=Miki Fujita;,citation_author=Regina Himmelspach;,citation_author=Charles H.

In the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) model system, we identified a novel D604N missense mutation, designated anisotropy1 (any1), in the essential primary cell wall CesA1. Most previously identified CesA1 mutants show severe constitutive or conditional phenotypes such as embryo lethality or arrest of cellulose production but any1 plants are viable and produce seeds, thus permitting the study of CesA1 function. The dwarf mutants have reduced anisotropic growth of roots, aerial organs, and trichomes. Interestingly, cellulose microfibrils were disordered only in the epidermal cells of the any1 inflorescence stem, whereas they were transverse to the growth axis in other tissues of the stem and in all elongated cell types of roots and dark-grown hypocotyls. Overall cellulose content was not altered but both cell wall crystallinity and the velocity of cellulose synthase complexes were reduced in any1. We crossed any1 with the temperature-sensitive radial swelling1-1 (rsw1-1) CesA1 mutant and observed partial complementation of the any1 phenotype in the transheterozygotes at rsw1-1’s permissive temperature (21^\circC) and full complementation by any1 of the conditional rsw1-1 root swelling phenotype at the restrictive temperature (29^\circC). In rsw1-1 homozygotes at restrictive temperature, a striking dissociation of cellulose synthase complexes from the plasma membrane was accompanied by greatly diminished motility of intracellular cellulose synthase-containing compartments.

However, the period of lignification in the compression wood was quite different from those of normal and opposite woods. The p-hydroxyphenyl units were deposited mainly in the early stage of cell wall formation in compound middle lamella in normal and opposite woods, while in compression wood, they were formed in both the compound middle lamella and the secondary wall. The most intensive lignification was observed during the formation of the S2 layer, proceeding from the outer to inner S2 layers for a long period in compression wood.

The two versions of Lignin (sa) were the acid detergent lignin (ADL) and Klason lignin (KL) methods. ABL and KL methods employ crude cell wall as the fibrous preparation while ADL uses acid detergent fiber. In vitro forage measures of degradability were negatively correlated with almost all lignin values, but the ABL method had the highest correlation coefficients for both grasses and legumes. Regression curves of ADL values with grass and legume IVDMD and IVNDF revealed different slopes, with steeper curves for grasses. With KL, grass and legume IVDMD and IVNDFD slopes were statistically similar and parallel. The results observed in the ADL and KL methods testify to the distance between the lines and data points, that is, these methods are poor predictors of NDF degradability. Grass and legume samples assayed with the ABL procedure, exhibited similar slopes, with parallel lines for both IVDMD and IVNDFD assays. Steeper inclination of curve for grasses relative to legumes in the ADL method may be attributed to partial loss of lignin during the procedure. This shows that ABL can accurately and consistently measure the inhibitory effect of lignin on degradation of structural carbohydrates of both grasses and legumes.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=RNA interference-inducing hairpin RNAs in plants act through the viral defence pathway;,citation_abstract=RNA interference (RNAi) is widely used to silence genes in plants and animals.

A similar process regulates the expression of some developmental genes through approximately 21 nt microRNAs. Plants have four types of Dicer-like (DCL) enzyme, each producing small RNAs with different functions. Here, we show that DCL2, DCL3 and DCL4 in Arabidopsis process both replicating viral RNAs and RNAi-inducing hairpin RNAs (hpRNAs) into 22-, 24- and 21 nt siRNAs, respectively, and that loss of both DCL2 and DCL4 activities is required to negate RNAi and to release the plant’s repression of viral replication. We also show that hpRNAs, similar to viral infection, can engender long-distance silencing signals and that hpRNA-induced silencing is suppressed by the expression of a virus-derived suppressor protein.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Laccase2 is required for cuticular pigmentation in stinkbugs;,citation_abstract=During the maturation of insect cuticle, protein-protein and protein-chitin crosslinkages are formed by the action of diphenoloxidases. Two types of diphenoloxidases, laccases and tyrosinases, are present in the insect cuticle. In coleopteran and hymenopteran insects, laccase2 gene has been identified as encoding an&nbsp;enzyme principally responsible for cuticular pigmentation and hardening, whereas biological roles of laccase genes in hemimetabolous insects remain to be established. Here we identified laccase2 genes from three hemipteran stinkbugs, Riptortus pedestris (Alydidae), Nysius plebeius (Lygaeidae) and Megacopta punctatissima (Plataspidae). In R. pedestris, laccase2 gene was highly expressed in epidermal tissues prior&nbsp;to&nbsp;molting. When the gene expression was suppressed by an RNA interference technique, cuticular pigmentation after molting were blocked depending on the dose of injected double-stranded RNA targeting the laccase2 gene. Similar results were obtained for N. plebeius and M. punctatissima. In all the stinkbug species, injecting 20. ng of double-stranded RNA was sufficient to prevent the cuticular maturation. These results indicate that laccase2 gene is generally required for cuticular pigmentation in different stinkbug families, highlighting its conserved biological function across diverse insect taxa. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.;,citation_author=Ryo Futahashi;,citation_author=Kohjiro Tanaka;,citation_author=Yu Matsuura;,citation_author=Masahiko Tanahashi;,citation_author=Yoshitomo Kikuchi;,citation_author=Takema Fukatsu;,citation_publication_date=2011;,citation_cover_date=2011;,citation_year=2011;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.ibmb.2010.12.003;,citation_isbn=1879-0240 (Electronic){\textbackslash}n0965-1748 (Linking);,citation_issn=09651748;,citation_pmid=21167282;,citation_volume=41;,citation_journal_title=Insect Biochem.

Both isoforms showed absorption maxima at 403 (Soret band), 500, and 640 nm, suggesting that both are high-spin ferric secretory class III peroxidases. Mr differences between them were due to the glycan moieties, and were confirmed from the total similarity of the N-terminal sequences (LSTTFYDTT) and by the 99.9% similarity of the tryptic fragment fingerprints obtained by reverse-phase nano-liquid chromatography. Four full-length cDNAs coding for these peroxidases were cloned. They only differ in the 5\prime-untranslated region. These differences probably indicate different ways in mRNA transport, stability, and regulation. According to the kcat and apparent KmRH values shown by both peroxidases for the three monolignols, sinapyl alcohol was the best substrate, the endwise polymerization of sinapyl alcohol by both ZePrxs yielding highly polymerized lignins with polymerization degrees \geq87. Western blots using anti-ZePrx34.70 IgGs showed that ZePrx33.44 was expressed in tracheary elements, roots, and hypocotyls, while ZePrx34.70 was only expressed in roots and young hypocotyls. None of the ZePrx isoforms was significantly expressed in either leaves or cotyledons.

Here, we identified an eight-core-component protein complex, the TPLATE complex, essential for plant growth via its role as major adaptor module for clathrin-mediated endocytosis. This complex consists of evolutionarily unique proteins that associate closely with core endocytic elements.

However, these modifications are often also associated with dwarfing and other changes in plant growth. Given the importance of nitrogen fixation for legume growth, we evaluated the impact of constitutively targeted lignin modification on the belowground organs (roots and nodules) of alfalfa plants. HCT down-regulated alfalfa plants exhibit a striking reduction in root growth accompanied by an unexpected increase in nodule numbers when grown in the greenhouse or in the field. This phenotype is associated with increased levels of gibberellins and certain flavonoid compounds in roots. Although HCT down-regulation reduced biomass yields in both the greenhouse and field experiments, the impact on the allocation of nitrogen to shoots or roots was minimal. It is unlikely, therefore, that the altered growth phenotype of reduced-lignin alfalfa is a direct result of changes in nodulation or nitrogen fixation efficiency. Furthermore, HCT down-regulation has no measurable effect on carbon allocation to roots in either greenhouse or 3-year field trials.;,citation_author=L. Gallego-Giraldo;,citation_author=K.

Plants with low-level expression of the WRKY dominant repressor construct produced lignified cell walls in pith tissues and exhibited enhanced biomass and biomass density, with an increase in total sugars in the cell wall fraction; however, lines with high expression of the WRKY dominant repressor construct exhibited a very different phenotype, with loss of interfascicular fibres associated with repression of the NST1 transcription factor. This latter phenotype was not observed in transgenic lines in which the WRKY transcription factor was down-regulated by RNA interference. Enhanced and/or ectopic deposition of secondary cell walls was also seen in corn and switchgrass expressing WRKY dominant repressor constructs, with enhanced biomass in corn but reduced biomass in switchgrass. Neutral detergent fibre digestibility was not impacted by WRKY expression in corn. Cell walls from WRKY-DR-expressing alfalfa plants with enhanced secondary cell wall formation exhibited increased sugar release efficiency, and WRKY dominant repressor expression further increased sugar release in alfalfa down-regulated in the COMT, but not the HCT, genes of lignin biosynthesis.

However, modifying lignin content and/or composition in transgenic plants through down-regulation of lignin biosynthetic enzymes can induce expression of defense response genes in the absence of biotic or abiotic stress. Arabidopsis thaliana lines with altered lignin through down-regulation of hydroxycinnamoyl CoA:shikimate/quinate hydroxycinnamoyl transferase (HCT) or loss of function of cinnamoyl CoA reductase 1 (CCR1) express a suite of pathogenesis-related (PR) protein genes. The plants also exhibit extensive cell wall remodeling associated with induction of multiple cell wall-degrading enzymes, a process which renders the corresponding biomass a substrate for growth of the cellulolytic thermophile Caldicellulosiruptor bescii lacking a functional pectinase gene cluster. The cell wall remodeling also results in the release of size- and charge-heterogeneous pectic oligosaccharide elicitors of PR gene expression. Genetic analysis shows that both in planta PR gene expression and release of elicitors are the result of ectopic expression in xylem of the gene ARABIDOPSIS DEHISCENCE ZONE POLYGALACTURONASE 1 (ADPG1), which is normally expressed during anther and silique dehiscence.

To improve the oxidation ability of this laccase towards bulky phenolic substrates, we designed a series of single-point mutants on the basis of the amino-acid layout inside the reducing substrate active site known from the crystal structure of the enzyme. Site-directed mutagenesis has addressed four phenylalanine residues in key positions 162, 265, 332, and 337 at the entrance of the binding pocket, as these residues appeared instrumental for docking of the substrate. These phenylalanines were replaced by smaller-sized but still apolar alanines. A double mutant F162A/F332A was also designed. Measurement of the oxidation efficiency towards encumbered phenols has shown that mutant F162A was more efficient than the wild-type laccase. The double mutant F162A/F332A led to 98% consumption of bisphenol A in only 5 h and was more efficient than the single mutants in the aerobic oxidation of this bulky substrate. In contrast, lack of appropriate hydrophobic interactions with the substrate possibly depresses the oxidation outcome with mutants F265A and F332A. One explanation for the lack of reactivity of mutant F337A, supported by literature reports, is that this residue is part of the second coordination shell of T1 Cu. A mutation at this position thus leads to a drastic coordination shell destabilization.

At present there is no general model that links these responses to changes in the organization and operation of microbial decomposer communities. Toward that end, we studied the response of litter and soil microbial communities to high levels of N amendment (30 and 80 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) in three types of northern temperate forest: sugar maple/basswood (SMBW), sugar maple/red oak (SMRO), and white oak/black oak (WOBO). We measured the activity of extracellular enzymes (EEA) involved directly in the oxidation of lignin and humus (phenol oxidase, peroxidase), and indirectly, through the production of hydrogen peroxide (glucose oxidase, glyoxal oxidase). Community composition was analyzed by extracting and quantifying phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) from soils. Litter EEA responses at SMBW sites diverged from those at oak-bearing sites (SMRO, BOWO), but the changes were not statistically significant. For soil, EEA responses were consistent across forests types: phenol oxidase and peroxidase activities declined as a function of N dose (33-73% and 5-41%, respectively, depending on forest type); glucose oxidase and glyoxal oxidase activities increased (200-400% and 150-300%, respectively, depending on forest type). Principal component analysis (PCA) ordinated forest types and treatment responses along two axes; factor 1 (44% of variance) was associated with phenol oxidase and peroxidase activities, factor 2 (31%) with glucose oxidase. Microbial biomass did not respond to N treatment, but nine of the 23 PLFA that formed &amp;amp;amp;gt;1 mol% of total biomass showed statistically significant treatment responses. PCA ordinated forest types and treatment responses along three axes (36%, 26%, 12% of variance). EEA factors I and 2 correlated negatively with PLFA factor I (r = -0.20 and -0.35, respectively, n = 108) and positively with PLFA factor 3 (r = +0.36 and +0.20, respectively, n = 108). In general, EEA responses were more strongly tied to changes in bacterial PLFA than to changes in fungal PLFA.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=FRA1 Kinesin Modulates the Lateral Stability of Cortical Microtubules through Cellulose Synthase–Microtubule Uncoupling Proteins;,citation_abstract=Cell wall assembly requires harmonized deposition of cellulose and matrix polysaccharides. Cortical microtubules orient the deposition of cellulose by guiding the trajectory of cellulose synthase complexes. Vesicles containing matrix polysaccharides are thought to be transported by the FRAGILE FIBER1 (FRA1) kinesin to facilitate their secretion along cortical microtubules. The cortical microtubule cytoskeleton thus may provide a platform to coordinate the delivery of cellulose and matrix polysaccharides, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we show that the tail region of the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) FRA1 kinesin physically interacts with cellulose synthase–microtubule uncoupling (CMU) proteins that are important for the microtubule-dependent guidance of cellulose synthase complexes. Interaction with CMUs did not affect microtubule binding or motility of the FRA1 kinesin but differentially affected the protein levels and microtubule localization of CMU1 and CMU2, thus regulating the lateral stability of cortical microtubules. Phosphorylation of the FRA1 tail region inhibited binding to CMUs and consequently reversed the extent of cortical microtubule decoration by CMU1 and CMU2. Genetic experiments demonstrated the significance of this interaction to the growth and reproduction of Arabidopsis plants. We propose that modulation of CMU protein levels and microtubule localization by FRA1 provides a mechanism that stabilizes the sites of deposition of both cellulose and matrix polysaccharides.;,citation_author=Anindya Ganguly;,citation_author=Chuanmei Zhu;,citation_author=Weizu Chen;,citation_author=Ram Dixit;,citation_publication_date=2020-08;,citation_cover_date=2020-08;,citation_year=2020;,citation_issue=8;,citation_doi=10.1105/tpc.19.00700;,citation_issn=1040-4651;,citation_volume=32;,citation_journal_title=Plant Cell;">

The effect of sap flow on radial O2 transport between stem and atmosphere was assessed by a stoichiometrical approach between respiratory CO2 production and O2 consumption. Restriction of sap flow set in 36.5 h after the onset of O2 depletion, and was complete after 71 h. Interruption of sap flow drastically increased the O2 deficit in the sapwood to 70%. Sap flow contributed about 60% to the total oxygen supply to the sapwood. Diurnal O2 flow rates varied between 3 and 6.3 nmol O2 m-2 leaf area (LA) s-1 during night- and daytime, respectively. Maximum O2 flow rates of 20 nmol O2 m-2 LA s-1 were reached at highest sap flow rates of 5.7 mmol H2O m-2 LA s-1.

Contact of the pollen tube with the ovule triggers calcium spiking in the synergids2,3 that induces pollen tube rupture and sperm release. This process, termed pollen tube reception, entails the action of three synergid-expressed proteins in Arabidopsis: FERONIA (FER), a receptor-like kinase; LORELEI (LRE), a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein; and NORTIA (NTA), a transmembrane protein of unknown function4–6. Genetic analyses have placed these three proteins in the same pathway; however, it remains unknown how they work together to enable synergid–pollen tube communication. Here we identify two pollen-tube-derived small peptides7 that belong to the rapid alkalinization factor (RALF) family8 as ligands for the FER–LRE co-receptor, which in turn recruits NTA to the plasma membrane. NTA functions as a calmodulin-gated calcium channel required for calcium spiking in the synergid. We also reconstitute the biochemical pathway in which FER–LRE perceives pollen-tube-derived peptides to activate the NTA calcium channel and initiate calcium spiking, a second messenger for pollen tube reception.

The enzyme is the object of intense biotechnological research, due to its employment in bioremediation of soils and water as well as in other biotechnological applications. We report here the cDNA and protein sequences, the post-translational modifications, the crystallization and X-ray structure determination of a laccase from the white-rot fungus Rigidoporus lignosus. The amino acid residues sequence deduced from cDNA clearly identified a pre-sequence of 21 residues representing the signal for extra-cellular localization. Mass spectrometry analysis performed on the salvage enzyme, confirmed the deduced sequence and precisely mapped two glycosylation sites at Asn337 and Asn435, determining the nature of the bound glycosidic moieties. The crystal structure was determined at 1.7 ?? resolution from perfectly hemihedrally twinned crystals, by molecular replacement technique. While the overall structure closely resembled those reported for other fungal laccases, the analysis of the T2/T3 trinuclear cluster revealed an unprecedented coordination sphere for the T3 copper pair. No bridging oxygen ligand was present between the two T3 copper ions, which were no longer symmetrically coordinated. The observed structure could represent an intermediate along the process of four-electron reduction of oxygen to water taking place at the trinuclear copper cluster. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Overexpression of ZePrx in Nicotiana tabacum Affects Lignin Biosynthesis Without Altering Redox Homeostasis;,citation_abstract=Class III plant peroxidases (Prxs) are involved in the oxidative polymerization of lignins. Zinnia elegans Jacq. Basic peroxidase (ZePrx) has been previously characterized as capable of catalyzing this reaction in vitro and the role in lignin biosynthesis of several of its Arabidopsis thaliana homologous has been previously confirmed. In the present work, ZePrx was overexpressed in Nicotiana tabacum to further characterize its function in planta with particular attention to its involvement in lignin biosynthesis. Since Prxs are known to alter ROS levels by using them as electron acceptor or producing them in their catalytic activity, the impact of this overexpression in redox homeostasis was studied by analyzing the metabolites and enzymes of the ascorbate-glutathione cycle. In relation to the modification induced by ZePrx overexpression in lignin composition and cellular metabolism, the carbohydrate composition of the cell wall as well as overall gene expression through RNA-Seq were analyzed. The obtained results indicate that the overexpression of ZePrx caused an increase in syringyl lignin in cell wall stems, suggesting that ZePrx is relevant for the oxidation of sinapyl alcohol during lignin biosynthesis, coherently with its S-peroxidase nature. The increase in the glucose content of the cell wall and the reduction of the expression of several genes involved in secondary cell wall biosynthesis suggests the occurrence of a possible compensatory response to maintain cell wall properties. The perturbation of cellular redox homeostasis occurring as a consequence of ZePrx overexpression was kept under control by an increase in APX activity and a reduction in ascorbate redox state. In conclusion, our results confirm the role of ZePrx in lignin biosynthesis and highlight that its activity alters cellular pathways putatively aimed at maintaining redox homeostasis.;,citation_author=Alba García-Ulloa;,citation_author=Laura Sanjurjo;,citation_author=Sara Cimini;,citation_author=Antonio Encina;,citation_author=Romina Martínez-Rubio;,citation_author=Rebeca Bouza;,citation_author=Luis Barral;,citation_author=Graciela Estévez-Pérez;,citation_author=Esther Novo-Uzal;,citation_author=Laura De Gara;,citation_author=Federico Pomar;,citation_publication_date=2020;,citation_cover_date=2020;,citation_year=2020;,citation_doi=10.3389/fpls.2020.00900;,citation_issn=1664-462X;,citation_volume=11;,citation_journal_title=Front.

We report here the first cloning of monocot laccases. Five different laccase-encoding cDNA sequences were identified from ryegrass (Lolium perenne); four from stem and one from meristematic tissue. Three cDNA’s contained entire coding sequences; LpLAC5-4 and LpLAC5-6 from stem, and LpLAC2-1 from meristem. LpLAC5-4 encodes a polypeptide of 610 amino acids with 14 potential N-glycosylation sites, and a calculated pI value of 5.0. Lack of an N-terminal signal peptide in LpLAC5-4 suggests that the mature protein is located intracellularly. A genomic clone, gLpLAC5-4, has been isolated and represents the first exon-intron structure and promoter sequence of a plant laccase gene. LpLAC5-6 cDNA encodes a protein of 579 amino acids with an N-terminal signal peptide characteristic of secreted proteins, 13 potential N-glycosylation sites, and a pI value of 9.0. LpLAC2-1 was the only laccase found in a meristematic library. The cDNA encodes a protein of 578 amino acids with a predicted pI of 5.8, 9 putative N-glycosylation sites, and an N-terminal signal peptide. Ryegrass laccases are differentially expressed and are under tight transcriptional control. Sequence analyses have shown that the ryegrass genome encodes more than 25 different laccase genes. Plant laccases are distributed in different groups rather than being closely intraspecies related. High heterogeneity of plant laccases indicates that gene duplication events have occurred continuously before and after divergence of seedplants into gymnosperms, monocots, and dicots. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=WRKY15 Suppresses Tracheary Element Differentiation Upstream of VND7 During Xylem Formation;,citation_abstract=Formation of the vascular cylinder, a structure critical to water and nutrient transport in higher plants, is highly regulated. Here we identify WRKY15 as an important regulator that suppresses tracheary element (TE) differentiation in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Overexpression of WRKY15 resulted in discontinuous protoxylem vessel files and TEs with reduced spiral wall thickening/lignification. Expression of a dominant-negative WRKY15 variant, WRKY15-EAR, led to extra protoxylem vessels and ectopic TEs with increased spiral wall thickening/lignification. Ectopic TE formation in the root cortex and hypocotyl/leaf epidermis reveals that the suppression of WRKY15 is sufficient to trigger the transdifferentiation of other types of cells to TEs. Expression profiling, RT-qPCR, and reporter analyses revealed that WRKY15 suppresses the expression of VASCULAR-RELATED NAC DOMAIN7 (VND7), a master transcriptional regulator that promotes TE differentiation. We propose that WRKY15 negatively regulates VND7 expression indirectly based on (1) the absence of a W-box in the promoter of VND7 and (2) the observation that WRKY15 and VND7 are expressed in different cells in the vascular cylinder, with WRKY15 expressed in the procambial cells and VND7 in the protoxylem poles of procambium and differentiating TEs.

On the other hand, there are increasing indications that it is part of a mechanism to withstand stress. Regardless of this controversy, alkalinization of the apoplast has received little attention. The apoplastic pH (pHapo) increases not only during plant–pathogen interactions but also in response to salinity or drought. Not much is known about the mechanisms that cause the leaf apoplast to alkalinize, nor whether, and if so, how functional impact is conveyed. Controversial explanations have been given, and the unusual complexity of pHapo regulation is considered as the primary reason behind this lack of knowledge. A gathering of scattered information revealed that changes in pHapo convey functionality by regulating stomatal aperture via the effects exerted on abscisic acid. Moreover, apoplastic alkalinization may regulate growth under stress, whereas this needs to be verified. In this review, a comprehensive survey about several physiological mechanisms that alkalize the apoplast under stress is given, and the suitability of apoplastic alkalinization as transducing element for the transmission of sensory information is discussed.;,citation_author=Christoph-Martin Geilfus;,citation_publication_date=2017-11;,citation_cover_date=2017-11;,citation_year=2017;,citation_issue=11;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.molp.2017.09.018;,citation_issn=1674-2052;,citation_volume=10;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Mol.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Rapid, combinatorial analysis of membrane compartments in intact plants with a multicolor marker set;,citation_abstract=Plant membrane compartments and trafficking pathways are highly complex, and are often distinct from those of animals and fungi. Progress has been made in defining trafficking in plants using transient expression systems. However, many processes require a precise understanding of plant membrane trafficking in a developmental context, and in diverse, specialized cell types. These include defense responses to pathogens, regulation of transporter accumulation in plant nutrition or polar auxin transport in development. In all of these cases a central role is played by the endosomal membrane system, which, however, is the most divergent and ill-defined aspect of plant cell compartmentation. We have designed a new vector series, and have generated a large number of stably transformed plants expressing membrane protein fusions to spectrally distinct, fluorescent tags. We selected lines with distinct subcellular localization patterns, and stable, non-toxic expression. We demonstrate the power of this multicolor “Wave” marker set for rapid, combinatorial analysis of plant cell membrane compartments, both in live-imaging and immunoelectron microscopy. Among other findings, our systematic co-localization analysis revealed that a class of plant Rab1-homologs has a much more extended localization than was previously assumed, and also localizes to trans-Golgi/endosomal compartments.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Endodermis;,citation_abstract=A Casparian strip-bearing endodermis is a feature that has been invariably present in the roots of ferns and angiosperms for approximately 400 million years. As the innermost cortical layer that surrounds the central vasculature of roots, the endodermis acts as a barrier to the free diffusion of solutes from the soil into the stele. Based on an enormous body of anatomical and physiological work, the protective endodermal diffusion barrier is thought to be of major importance for many aspects of root biology, reaching from efficient water and nutrient transport to defense against soil-borne pathogens. Until recently, however, we were ignorant about the genes and mechanisms that drive the differentiation of this intricately structured barrier. Recent work in Arabidopsis has now identified the first major players in Casparian strip formation. A mechanistic understanding of endodermal differentiation will finally allow us to specifically interfere with endodermal barrier function and study the effects on plant growth and survival under various stress conditions. Here, I critically review the major findings and models related to endodermal structure and function from other plant species and assess them in light of recent molecular data from Arabidopsis, pointing out where the older, descriptive work can provide a framework and inspiration for further molecular dissection.;,citation_author=Niko Geldner;,citation_publication_date=2013;,citation_cover_date=2013;,citation_year=2013;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1146/annurev-arplant-050312-120050;,citation_isbn=1545-2123 (Electronic){\textbackslash}r1543-5008 (Linking);,citation_issn=1543-5008;,citation_pmid=23451777;,citation_volume=64;,citation_journal_title=Annu.

It ensures that the asymmetry of actin architec ture along cell periphery directs the organization of microtubules in cell interior. In particular, the way the two networks are physically inter-twined regulates the spatial organization and the distribution of forces in the microtubule network. While their biochemical crosstalk is getting uncovered, their mechanical crosstalk is still poorly understood. Here we designed an in vitro reconstitution assay to study the physical interaction between dynamic microtubules with various structures made of actin fil aments. We found that microtubules can align and move by their polymerization force along linear bundles of actin filaments. But they cannot enter dense and branched actin meshworks, such as those found in the lamellipodium along cell periphery. However, when microtubules are immobilized, by their crosslinking with actin structures or others means, the force of polymerization builds up pressure in the microtubules that is sufficient to allow them to breach and penetrate these dense actin meshworks. This mechanism may explain the final progression of microtubules up to cell periphery through the denser parts of the actin network.;,citation_author=Matthieu Gélin;,citation_author=Alexandre Schaeffer;,citation_author=Jérémie Gaillard;,citation_author=Christophe Guérin;,citation_author=Benoit Vianay;,citation_author=Magali Orhant-Prioux;,citation_author=Marcus Braun;,citation_author=Christophe Leterrier;,citation_author=Laurent Blanchoin;,citation_author=Manuel Théry;,citation_publication_date=2023-05;,citation_cover_date=2023-05;,citation_year=2023;,citation_doi=10.1101/2023.05.15.540482;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_publisher=bioRxiv;">

The aproach applies multivariate curve resolution by alternate regression (MCR-AR) and automated peak assignment. MCR-AR employs parallel processing of multiple chromatograms, as opposed to sequential processing used in prevailing applications. Parallel processing provides a global peak list that is consistent for all chromatograms, and therefore does not require tedious manual curation. We evaluated this approach on wood samples from aspen and Norway spruce, and found that parallel processing results in an overall higher precision of peak area from integrated peaks. To further increase the speed of data processing we evaluated automated peak assignment solely based on basepeak mass. This approach gave estimates of the proportion of lignin (as syringyl-, guaiacyl and p-hydroxyphenyl-type lignin) and carbohydrate polymers in the wood samples that were in high agreement with those where peak assignments were based on full spectra.

Spectroscopic and Magnetic Investigations of Products Due to Reactions between Copper(I) Complexes of Xylyl-Based Dinucleating Ligands and Dioxygen: Aromatic Ring Hydroxylation and Irreversible Oxidation Product;,citation_abstract=A full account of a chemical system possessing features that mimic the reactivity aspects of tyrosinase is presented. Using dinucleating ligands with a m-xylyl spacer three new dicopper(I) complexes have been synthesized and their reactivity with dioxygen investigated. The six-membered chelate ring forming ligands provide only two nitrogen coordinations to each copper. The complexes [Cu(I)(2)L(CH(3)CN)(2)]X(2) (X = ClO(4)(-) (1a), SbF(6)(-) (1b)) and [Cu(I)(2)(L-NO(2))(CH(3)CN)(2)][SbF(6)](2) (1c) [L = alpha,alpha’-bis[N-methyl-N-(2-pyridylethyl)amino]-m-xylene; L-NO(2) = para-nitro derivative of L] have been characterized by IR and (1)H NMR spectroscopy. The reaction of O(2) with 1a-c in CH(2)Cl(2) or THF is instantaneous and causes stoichiometric xylyl hydroxylation reactions producing phenol products. Thus 1a produces phenoxo-/hydroxo-bridged product [Cu(II)(2)(L-O)(OH)][ClO(4)](2) (2a). The existence of putative peroxo-dicopper(II) species could not be detected even at -80 degrees C. A trend is observed for the extent of aromatic ring hydroxylation (298 K): CH(3)CN approximately DMF &amp;amp;amp;gt; CH(3)OH &amp;gt; CH(2)Cl(2). Cyclic voltammetric experiment of 1a in DMF reveals an appreciably low redox potential (E(1/2) = -0.26 V vs SCE) for the Cu(II)(2)/Cu(I)(2) redox process. Variable-temperature (25-300 K) magnetic susceptibility measurements establish that the copper(II) centers in 2a and the dihydroxo-bridged complex [Cu(II)(2)L’(OH)(2)][ClO(4)](2) (2b) [formed due to an impurity (L’) present during the synthesis of L following Method A; L’ = bis[alpha,alpha’-bis(N-methyl-N-(2-pyridylethyl)amino)-m-xylene]methylamine] are antiferromagnetically coupled, with 2a considerably more coupled than 2b.

In agreement with its proposed hydroxo-/aquo-bridged structure, 3a is weakly antiferromagnetically coupled. In CH(3)CN solution, 3a rearranges to generate a doubly hydroxo-bridged species [Cu(II)(2)L(OH)(2)](2+). Using a solution-generated dicopper(I) complex of a closely similar ligand (L’ ’) providing five-membered chelate ring, the reactivity toward dioxygen was also investigated. It produces only an irreversibly oxidized product of composition Cu(II)(2)L’ ’(OH)(ClO(4))(3)(H(2)O)(2) (3b) (L’ ’ = alpha,alpha’-bis[N-methyl-N-(2-pyridylmethyl)amino]-m-xylene).

The axial methionine (Met) ligand is unconstrained in the oxidized NiRs, which results in an enthalpically favored (DeltaH approximately 4.6 kcal/mol) Met-bound green copper site at low temperatures, and an entropically favored (TDeltaS approximately 4.5 kcal/mol, at room temperature) Met-elongated blue copper site at elevated temperatures. In contrast to the NiRs, the classic blue copper sites in plastocyanin and azurin show no temperature-dependent behavior, indicating that a single species is present at all temperatures. For these blue copper proteins, the polypeptide matrix opposes the gain in entropy that would be associated with the loss of the weak axial Met ligand at physiological temperatures by constraining its coordination to copper.

The cellular structure of plants varies too, from the largely honeycomb-like cells of wood to the closed-cell, liquid-filled foam-like parenchyma cells of apples and potatoes and to composites of these two cellular structures, as in arborescent palm stems. The arrangement of the four basic building blocks in plant cell walls and the variations in cellular structure give rise to a remarkably wide range of mechanical properties: Young’s modulus varies from 0.3 MPa in parenchyma to 30 GPa in the densest palm, while the compressive strength varies from 0.3 MPa in parenchyma to over 300 MPa in dense palm.

Every Raman image is based on thousands of spectra, each being a spatially resolved molecular ’fingerprint’ of the cell wall. Multiple components are analyzed within the native cell walls, and insights into polymer composition as well as the orientation of the cellulose microfibrils can be gained. The most labor-intensive step of this process is often the sample preparation, as the imaging approach requires a flat surface of the plant tissue with intact cell walls. After finishing the map (acquisition time is similar to 10 min to 10 h, depending on the size of the region of interest and scanning parameters), many possibilities exist for the analysis of spectral data and image generation.;,citation_author=Notburga Gierlinger;,citation_author=Tobias Keplinger;,citation_author=Michael Harrington;,citation_publication_date=2012;,citation_cover_date=2012;,citation_year=2012;,citation_issue=9;,citation_doi=10.1038/nprot.2012.092;,citation_issn=17542189;,citation_volume=7;,citation_journal_title=Nat.

In combination with microscopy, the chemical composition can be followed in context with the microstructure, and due to the non-destructive application, in-situ studies of changes during, e.g., degradation or mechanical load are possible. The two complementary vibrational microspectroscopic approaches, Fourier-Transform Infrared (FT-IR) Microspectroscopy and Confocal Raman spectroscopy, are based on different physical principles and the resulting different drawbacks and advantages in plant applications are reviewed. Examples for FT-IR and Raman microscopy applications on plant cell walls, including imaging as well as in-situ studies, are shown to have high potential to get a deeper understanding of structure-function relationships as well as biological processes and technical treatments. Both probe numerous different molecular vibrations of all components at once and thus result in spectra with many overlapping bands, a challenge for assignment and interpretation.

This work aimed at uncovering the function(s) of NME in a whole proteome, using the chloroplast-encoded proteins of both Arabidopsis thaliana and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii as model systems. Disruption of PDF1B in A.thaliana led to an albino phenotype, and an extreme sensitivity to the PDF- specific inhibitor actinonin. In contrast, a knockout line for PDF1A exhibited no apparent phenotype. Photosystem II activity in C.reinhardtii cells was substantially reduced by the presence of actinonin. Pulse-chase experiments revealed that PDF inhibition leads to destabilization of a crucial subset of chloroplast-encoded photosystem II components in C. reinhardtii. The same proteins were destabilized in pdf1b. Site-directed substitutions altering NME of the most sensitive target, subunit D2, resulted in similar effects. Thus, plastid NME is a critical mechanism specifically influencing the life-span of photosystem II polypeptides.

These processes are regulated by protein–protein interactions and the formation of larger protein complexes, which also occur within biological membranes. To gain a large-scale overview of complex-forming proteins and the composition of such complexes within the cellular membranes of Arabidopsis roots, we use the combination of size-exclusion chromatography and mass spectrometry. First, we identified complex-forming proteins by a retention shift analysis relative to expected retention times of monomeric proteins during size-exclusion chromatography. In a second step we predicted complex composition through pairwise correlation of elution profiles. As result we present an interactome of 963 proteins within cellular membranes of Arabidopsis roots. Identification of complex-forming proteins was highly robust between two independently grown root proteomes. The protein complex composition derived from pairwise correlations of coeluting proteins reproducibly identified stable protein complexes (ribosomes, proteasome, mitochondrial respiratory chain supercomplexes) but showed higher variance between replicates regarding transient interactions (e.g., interactions with kinases) within membrane protein complexes.;,citation_author=Max Gilbert;,citation_author=Waltraud X.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Nativity of lignin carbohydrate bonds substantiated by biomimetic synthesis;,citation_abstract=The question of whether lignin is covalently linked to carbohydrates in native wood, forming what is referred to as lignin–carbohydrate complexes (LCCs), still lacks unequivocal proof.

Thus, the correlation between the structure of the isolated LCCs and LCCs in situ remains open. As a way to circumvent the problematic isolation, biomimicking lignin polymerization in vivo and in vitro is an interesting option. Herein, we report the detection of lignin–carbohydrate bonds in the extracellular lignin formed by tissue-cultured Norway spruce cells, and in modified biomimetic lignin synthesis (dehydrogenation polymers). Semi-quantitative 2D heteronuclear singular quantum coherence (HSQC)-, 31P -, and 13C-NMR spectroscopy were applied as analytical tools. Combining results from these systems, four types of lignin–carbohydrate bonds were detected; benzyl ether, benzyl ester, \gamma-ester, and phenyl glycoside linkages, providing direct evidence of lignin–carbohydrate bond formation in biomimicked lignin polymerization.

A kinetic analysis has allowed for the first time the determination of individual rate constants for several of the partial reactions that comprise the catalytic cycle. Mushroom tyrosinase rapidly reacts with dioxygen with a second-order rate constant k(+8) = 2.3 x 10(7) M(-)(1) s(-)(1), which is similar to that reported for hemocyanins [(1.3 x 10(6))-(5.7 x 10(7)) M(-)(1) s(-)(1)]. Deoxytyrosinase binds dioxygen reversibly at the binuclear Cu(I) site with a dissociation constant K(D)(O)()2 = 46.6 microM, which is similar to the value (K(D)(O)()2 = 90 microM) reported for the binding of dioxygen to Octopus vulgaris deoxyhemocyanin [Salvato et al.

Transient and steady-state kinetics showed that o-diphenols such as 4-tert-butylcatechol react significantly faster with mettyrosinase (k(+2) = 9.02 x 10(6) M(-)(1) s(-)(1)) than with oxytyrosinase (k(+6) = 5.4 x 10(5) M(-)(1) s(-)(1)). This difference is interpreted in terms of differential steric and polar effects that modulate the access of o-diphenols to the active site for these two forms of the enzyme. The values of k(cat) for several o-diphenols are also consistent with steric and polar factors controlling the mobility, orientation, and thence the reactivity of substrates at the active site of tyrosinase.;,citation_author=Mor Goldfeder;,citation_author=Margarita Kanteev;,citation_author=Sivan Isaschar-Ovdat;,citation_author=Noam Adir;,citation_author=Ayelet Fishman;,citation_publication_date=2014;,citation_cover_date=2014;,citation_year=2014;,citation_doi=10.1038/ncomms5505;,citation_isbn=0021-9258 (Print){\textbackslash}r0021-9258;,citation_issn=20411723;,citation_pmid=16436386;,citation_volume=5;,citation_journal_title=Nat.

VP can oxidize a wide variety of phenols, including hydroquinones, either directly in a manner similar to horseradish peroxidase (HRP), or indirectly through Mn3+ formed from Mn2+ oxidation, in a manner similar to manganese peroxidase (MnP). From several possible buffers (all pH 5), tartrate buffer was selected to study the oxidation of hydroquinones as it did not support the Mn2+-mediated activity of VP in the absence of exogenous H2O2 (unlike glyoxylate and oxalate buffers). In the absence of Mn2+, efficient hydroquinone oxidation by VP was dependent on exogenous H2O2. Under these conditions, semiquinone radicals produced by VP autoxidized to a certain extent producing superoxide anion radical (O2*-) that spontaneously dismutated to H2O2 and O2. The use of this peroxide by VP produced quinone in an amount greater than equimolar to the initial H2O2 (a quinone/H2O2 molar ratio of 1 was only observed under anaerobic conditions). In the presence of Mn2+, exogenous H2O2 was not required for complete oxidation of hydroquinone by VP. Reaction blanks lacking VP revealed H2O2 production due to a slow conversion of hydroquinone into semiquinone radicals (probably via autooxidation catalysed by trace amounts of free metal ions), followed by O2*- production through semiquinone autooxidation and O2*- reduction by Mn2+. This peroxide was used by VP to oxidize hydroquinone that was mainly carried out through Mn2+ oxidation. By comparing the activity of VP to that of MnP and HRP, it was found that the ability of VP and MnP to oxidize Mn2+ greatly increased hydroquinone oxidation efficiency.;,citation_author=Víctor Gómez-Toribio;,citation_author=Angel T.

This process, known as enzymatic browning, is the cause of undesirable changes in organoleptic properties and the loss of nutritional quality in plant-derived products. In potato (Solanum tubersoum L.), PPOs are encoded by a multi-gene family with different expression patterns. Here, we have studied the application of the CRISPR/Cas9 system to induce mutations in the StPPO2 gene in the tetraploid cultivar Desiree. We hypothesized that the specific knock outediting of this target gene would result in a lower PPO activity in the tuber with the consequent reduction of the enzymatic browning.

Up to 68% of regenerated plants contained mutations in at least one allele of the target gene, while 24% of edited lines carried mutations in all four alleles. No off-target mutations were identified in other analyzed StPPO genes. Mutations induced in the four alleles of StPPO2 gene, led to lines with a reduction of up to 69% in tuber PPO activity and a reduction of 73% in enzymatic browning, compared to the control.

These P450 enzymes were reported to associate with each other or potentially with other soluble monolignol biosynthetic enzymes to form an enzyme complex or a metabolon. However, the molecular basis governing such enzyme or pathway organization remains elusive.

We find that although C4H, C3’ H and F5H are in spatial proximity to each other on the ER membrane in vivo, they do not appear to directly interact with each other. Instead, two MSBP proteins physically interact with all three P450 enzymes and, moreover, MSBPs themselves associate as homomers and heteromers on the ER membrane, thereby organizing P450 clusters. Downregulation of MSBP genes does not affect the transcription levels of monolignol bio- synthetic P450 genes but substantially impairs the stability and activity of the MSBP-interacting P450 enzymes and, conse- quently, lignin deposition, and the accumulation of soluble phenolics in the monolignol branch but not in the flavonoid pathway. Our study suggests that MSBP proteins are essential structural components in the ER membrane that physically organize and stabilize the monolignol biosynthetic P450 enzyme complex, thereby specifically controlling phenylpropanoid–monolignol branch biosynthesis.;,citation_author=Mingyue Gou;,citation_author=Xiuzhi Ran;,citation_author=Dwight W.

The structural characteristics of lignin subunits are essentially determined by three cytochrome P450-catalzyed reactions. NADPH-dependent cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (CPR) is commonly regarded as the electron carrier for P450-catalyzed reactions during monolignol biosynthesis. Here, we show that cytochrome b &nbsp;5 isoform D (CB5D) is an indispensable electron shuttle protein specific for S-lignin biosynthesis. Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) CB5D localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and physically associates with monolignol P450 enzymes. Disrupting CB5D in Arabidopsis resulted in a &amp;amp;gt;60% reduction in S-lignin subunit levels but no impairment in G-lignin formation compared with the wild type, which sharply contrasts with the impaired G- and S-lignin synthesis observed after disrupting ATR2, encoding Arabidopsis CPR. The defective S-lignin synthesis in cb5d mutants was rescued by the expression of the gene encoding CB5D but not with mutant CB5D devoid of its electron shuttle properties. Disrupting ATR2 suppressed the catalytic activity of both cinnamic acid 4-hydroxylase and ferulate 5-hydroxylase (F5H), but eliminating CB5D specifically depleted the latter’s activity. Therefore, CB5D functions as an obligate electron shuttle intermediate that specifically augments F5H-catalyzed reactions, thereby controlling S-lignin biosynthesis.;,citation_author=Mingyue Gou;,citation_author=Xiaoman Yang;,citation_author=Yunjun Zhao;,citation_author=Xiuzhi Ran;,citation_author=Yanzhai Song;,citation_author=Chang-Jun Liu;,citation_publication_date=2019-06;,citation_cover_date=2019-06;,citation_year=2019;,citation_issue=6;,citation_doi=10.1105/tpc.18.00778;,citation_issn=1040-4651;,citation_volume=31;,citation_journal_title=Plant Cell;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Severe inhibition of maize wall degradation by synthetic lignins formed with coniferaldehyde;,citation_abstract=Although the enzymatic or ruminal degradability of plants deficient in cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) is often greater than their normal counterparts, factors responsible for these degradability differences have not been identified. Since lignins in CAD deficient plants often contain elevated concentrations of aldehydes, we used a cell-wall model system to evaluate what effect aldehyde-containing lignins have on the hydrolysis of cell walls by fungal enzymes. Varying ratios of coniferaldehyde and coniferyl alcohol were polymerised into non-lignified primary walls of maize (Zea mays L) by wall-bound peroxidase and exogenously supplied H2O2. Coniferaldehyde lignins formed fewer cross-linked structures with other wall components, but they were much more inhibitory to cell wall degradation than lignins formed with coniferyl alcohol. This suggests that the improved degradability of CAD deficient plants is not related to the incorporation of p-hydroxycinnamaldehyde units into lignin. Degradability differences were diminished if enzyme loadings were increased and if hydrophobic aldehyde groups in lignins were reduced to their corresponding alcohols by ethanolic sodium borohydride. © 1998 Society of Chemical Industry.;,citation_author=John H.

DNA methylation level and pattern were analysed in actively growing organs, under short- (6 h) and long- (2 d or 4 d) term and low (10 \muM) and high (50 \muM) doses of Cd, through a Methylation-Sensitive Amplification Polymorphism technique and an immunocytological approach, respectively.

Nuclear chromatin ultrastructure was investigated by transmission electron microscopy. Cd treatment induced a DNA hypermethylation, as well as an up-regulation of CMT, indicating that de novo methylation did indeed occur. Moreover, a high dose of Cd led to a progressive heterochromatinization of interphase nuclei and apoptotic figures were also observed after long-term treatment.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Phylogenomics reveals multiple losses of nitrogen-fixing root nodule symbiosis;,citation_abstract=A symbiosis between certain bacteria and their plant hosts delivers fixed nitrogen to the plants. Griesmann et al. sequenced several plant genomes to analyze why nitrogen-fixing symbiosis is irregularly scattered through the evolutionary tree (see the Perspective by Nagy). Various genomes carried traces of lost pathways that could have supported nitrogen-fixing symbiosis. It seems that this symbiosis, which relies on multiple pathways and complex interorganismal signaling, is susceptible to selection and prone to being lost over evolutionary time. Science , this issue p. [eaat1743][1]; see also p. [125][2] ### INTRODUCTION Access to nutrients such as nitrogen is required for plant growth. Legumes and nine additional plant families benefit from the nitrogen-fixing root nodule (NFN) symbiosis, in which roots develop nodules that intracellularly host nitrogen-fixing bacteria. In this mutually beneficial symbiosis, the bacteria convert atmospheric nitrogen into ammonium and deliver it to the host plant. NFN symbiosis thus enables plant survival under nitrogen-limiting conditions in terrestrial ecosystems. In agriculture, this symbiosis reduces reliance on nitrogen fertilizer, thus reducing the costs, ecological impact, and fossil fuel consumption attendant on large-scale application of fertilizers. ### RATIONALE Molecular phylogenies show that NFN symbiosis is restricted to four angiosperm orders—Fabales, Fagales, Cucurbitales, and Rosales—that together form the monophyletic NFN clade. However, only 10 of the 28 plant families within this clade contain species engaged in the NFN symbiosis. Even within these 10 families, most genera do not form this symbiosis. The NFN symbiosis requires the coordinated function of more than 30 essential genes. Presence of this symbiosis in related families suggests that a genetic change in the ancestor of the NFN clade enabled evolution of NFN symbiosis in this clade. The scattered distribution of functional NFN symbiosis across the clade has led to the question of whether NFN symbiosis evolved multiple times independently in a convergent manner or was lost multiple times regardless of the number of times it arose. Fossil data have been unable to answer this question. Here we used molecular evidence to ask how the current pattern of plant species with NFN symbiosis evolved. ### RESULTS We sequenced the genomes of seven nodulating species belonging to the Fagales, Rosales, and Cucurbitales orders and the legume subfamily Caesalpinioideae. We complemented this dataset by sequencing three genomes of nonnodulating species from the Cucurbitales and from the legume subfamilies Cercidoideae and Papilionoideae. Using a genome-wide phylogenomic approach, we found that all legume genes with a characterized role in NFN symbiosis are conserved in nodulating species with one exception. We observed larger numbers of order-specific gene family expansions that, solely because of their phylogenetic distribution, may include genes contributing to multiple gains or subsequent refinements of the symbiosis. In parallel, we discovered signatures of multiple independent loss-of-function events for the gene encoding the indispensable NFN symbiosis regulator&nbsp; NODULE INCEPTION &nbsp;( NIN ) in 10 of 13 genomes of nonnodulating species within the NFN clade. The pattern suggests at least eight independent losses of NFN symbiosis. ### CONCLUSION We found that multiple independent losses of NFN symbiosis occurred in the four orders of the NFN clade. These results suggest that NFN symbiosis has previously been more common than currently evident and that this symbiosis is subject to an underestimated adverse selection pressure. ![Figure][3]&amp;amp;amp;lt;/img&amp;gt; Phylogenomics and evolution of NFN symbiosis. Genome sequencing of nodulating and nonnodulating species combined with 27 previously available genomes resulted in a dataset spanning the NFN clade and species outside the NFN clade as an outgroup. Orthogroups were identified and filtered following three phylogenetic patterns. This genome-wide analysis identified two genes involved in NFN symbiosis, NIN and RHIZOBIUM-DIRECTED POLAR GROWTH ( RPG ), that were lost in most nonnodulating species. The occurrence of multiple losses (red crosses) of NFN symbiosis suggests an adverse selection pressure. The root nodule symbiosis of plants with nitrogen-fixing bacteria affects global nitrogen cycles and food production but is restricted to a subset of genera within a single clade of flowering plants. To explore the genetic basis for this scattered occurrence, we sequenced the genomes of 10 plant species covering the diversity of nodule morphotypes, bacterial symbionts, and infection strategies. In a genome-wide comparative analysis of a total of 37 plant species, we discovered signatures of multiple independent loss-of-function events in the indispensable symbiotic regulator NODULE INCEPTION in 10 of 13 genomes of nonnodulating species within this clade. The discovery that multiple independent losses shaped the present-day distribution of nitrogen-fixing root nodule symbiosis in plants reveals a phylogenetically wider distribution in evolutionary history and a so-far-underestimated selection pressure against this symbiosis.

The involvement of additional CESA proteins in this process and details concerning the manner in which cellulose is deposited in the mucilage pocket are unknown. Here, we show that both CESA3 and CESA10 are highly expressed in this cell type at the time of mucilage synthesis and localize to the plasma membrane adjacent to the mucilage pocket. The isoxaben resistant1-1 and isoxaben resistant1-2 mutants affecting CESA3 show defects consistent with altered mucilage cellulose biosynthesis. CESA3 can interact with CESA5 in vitro, and green fluorescent protein-tagged CESA5, CESA3, and CESA10 proteins move in a linear, unidirectional fashion around the cytoplasmic column of the cell, parallel with the surface of the seed, in a pattern similar to that of cortical microtubules. Consistent with this movement, cytological evidence suggests that the mucilage is coiled around the columella and unwinds during mucilage extrusion to form a linear ray. Mutations in CESA5 and CESA3 affect the speed of mucilage extrusion and mucilage adherence. These findings imply that cellulose fibrils are synthesized in an ordered helical array around the columella, providing a distinct structure to the mucilage that is important for both mucilage extrusion and adherence.;,citation_author=Jonathan S.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Regulation of immune receptor kinases plasma membrane nanoscale landscape by a plant peptide hormone and its receptors;,citation_abstract=Spatial partitioning is a propensity of biological systems orchestrating cell activities in space and time. The dynamic regulation of plasma membrane nano-environments has recently emerged as a key fundamental aspect of plant signaling, but the molecular components governing it are still mostly unclear. The receptor kinase FERONIA (FER) controls complex formation of the immune receptor kinase FLAGELLIN SENSING 2 (FLS2) with its co-receptor BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1-ASSOCIATED KINASE 1 (BAK1), and this function is inhibited by the FER ligand RAPID ALKALANIZATION FACTOR 23 (RALF23). Here, we show that FER regulates the plasma membrane nanoscale organization of FLS2 and BAK1. Our study demonstrates that akin to FER, leucine-rich repeat (LRR) extensin (LRXs) proteins contribute to RALF23 responsiveness, regulate BAK1 nanoscale organization and immune signaling. Furthermore, RALF23 perception leads to rapid modulation of FLS2 and BAK1 nanoscale organization and its inhibitory activity on immune signaling relies on FER kinase activity. Our results suggest that perception of RALF peptides by FER and LRXs actively modulates the plasma membrane nanoscale landscape to regulate cell surface signaling by other receptor kinases.;,citation_author=Julien Gronnier;,citation_author=Christina M.

A review of recent progress in biology and digital sciences suggests that such strategies might be universal: many living and technological systems favor the interests of the population to the detriment of individuals, at all scales. They behave in a suboptimal manner, restraining short-term performances while ensuring a high level of global resilience. This paper describes the features of such suboptimal systems. By synthesizing numerous examples within biological, and socio-cultural systems, we show how suboptimality might constitute a powerful source of inspiration to address the numerous trade-offs humanity is facing in the anthropocene. Should human societies curb their performance for the now anthropic ecosystems to be resilient? New research themes, such as soft law, agroecology, and planetary health, already echo suboptimal behaviors.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=High-efficiency genome editing in plants mediated by a Cas9 gene containing multiple introns;,citation_abstract=The recent discovery of the mode of action of the CRISPR/Cas9 system has provided biologists with a useful tool for generating site-specific mutations in genes of interest. In plants, site-targeted mutations are usually obtained by the stable transformation of a Cas9 expression construct into the plant genome. The efficiency of introducing mutations in genes of interest can vary considerably depending on the specific features of the constructs, including the source and nature of the promoters and terminators used for the expression of the Cas9 gene and the guide RNA, and the sequence of the Cas9 nuclease itself. To optimize the efficiency of the Cas9 nuclease in generating mutations in target genes in Arabidopsis thaliana, we investigated several features of its nucleotide and/or amino acid sequence, including the codon usage, the number of nuclear localization signals (NLSs), and the presence or absence of introns. We found that the Cas9 gene codon usage had some effect on its activity and that two NLSs worked better than one. However, the highest efficiency of the constructs was achieved by the addition of 13 introns into the Cas9 coding sequence, which dramatically improved the editing efficiency of the constructs. None of the primary transformants obtained with a Cas9 gene lacking introns displayed a knockout mutant phenotype, whereas between 70% and 100% of the primary transformants generated with the intronized Cas9 gene displayed mutant phenotypes.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Specificity of the wound-induced leucine aminopeptidase (LAP-A) of tomato: Activity on dipeptide and tripeptide substrates;,citation_abstract=Wounding of tomato leaves results in the accumulation of an exoprotease called leucine aminopeptidase (LAP-A) that preferentially hydrolyzes amino acid-p-nitroanilide and -beta-naphthylamide substrates with N-terminal Leu, Met and Arg residues. To determine the substrate specificity of LAP-A on more natural substrates, the rates of hydrolysis of 60 dipeptide and seven tripeptide substrates were determined. For comparison, the specificities of the porcine and Escherichia coli LAPs were evaluated in parallel. Several marked differences in substrate specificities for the animal, plant and prokaryotic LAP enzymes were observed. Substrates with variable N-terminal (P1) residues (Xaa) were evaluated; these substrates had Leu or Gly in the penultimate (P1’) position. The plant, animal, and prokaryotic LAPs hydrolyzed dipeptides with N-terminal nonpolar aliphatic (Leu, Val, Ile, and Ala), basic (Arg), and sulfur-containing (Met) residues rapidly, while P1 Asp or Gly were cleaved inefficiently from peptides. Significant differences in the cleavage of dipeptides with P1 aromatic residues (Phe, Tyr, and Trp) were noted. To systematically evaluate the impact of the P1’ residue on cleavage of dipeptides, three series of dipeptides (Leu-Xaa, Gly-Xaa, and Arg-Xaa) were evaluated. The P1’ residue strongly influenced hydrolysis of dipeptides and the magnitude of its effect was dependent on the P1 residue. P1’ Pro, Asp, Lys and Gly slowed the hydrolysis rates of the tomato LAP-A, porcine LAP, and E. coli PepA markedly. Analysis six Arg-Gly-Xaa tripeptides showed that more diversity was tolerated in the P2’ position. P2’ Arg inhibited tripeptide cleavage by all three enzymes, while P2’ Asp enhanced hydrolysis rates for the porcine and prokaryotic LAPs.;,citation_author=Yong Qiang Gu;,citation_author=Linda L.

Enzymes, sugars, and other cell wall components are constantly and actively transported to and from the plasma membrane during diffuse growth. Cell wall components are transported in vesicles on cytoskeletal tracks composed of microtubules and actin filaments. Many of these components, and additional proteins, vesicles, and lipids are trafficked to and from the cell plate during cytokinesis. In this review, we first discuss how the cytoskeleton is initially organized to add new cell wall material or to build a new cell wall, focusing on similarities during these processes. Next, we discuss how polysaccharides and enzymes that build the cell wall are trafficked to the correct location by motor proteins and through other interactions with the cytoskeleton.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Characterization of the Alkaline Laccase Ssl1 from Streptomyces sviceus with Unusual Properties Discovered by Genome Mining;,citation_abstract=Fungal laccases are well investigated enzymes with high potential in diverse applications like bleaching of waste waters and textiles, cellulose delignification, and organic synthesis. However, they are limited to acidic reaction conditions and require eukaryotic expression systems. This raises a demand for novel laccases without these constraints. We have taken advantage of the laccase engineering database LccED derived from genome mining to identify and clone the laccase Ssl1 from Streptomyces sviceus which can circumvent the limitations of fungal laccases. Ssl1 belongs to the family of small laccases that contains only few characterized enzymes. After removal of the twin-arginine signal peptide Ssl1 was readily expressed in E. coli. Ssl1 is a small laccase with 32.5 kDa, consists of only two cupredoxin-like domains, and forms trimers in solution. Ssl1 oxidizes 2,2’-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) and phenolic substrates like 2,6-dimethoxy phenol, guaiacol, and syringaldazine. The k(cat) value for ABTS oxidation was at least 20 times higher than for other substrates. The optimal pH for oxidation reactions is substrate dependent: for phenolic substrates the highest activities were detected at alkaline conditions (pH 9.0 for 2,6-dimethoxy phenol and guaiacol and pH 8.0 for syringaldazine), while the highest reaction rates with ABTS were observed at pH 4.0. Though originating from a mesophilic organism, Ssl demonstrates remarkable stability at elevated temperatures (T(1/2,60^\circC) = 88 min) and in a wide pH range (pH 5.0 to 11.0). Notably, the enzyme retained 80% residual activity after 5 days of incubation at pH 11. Detergents and organic co-solvents do not affect Ssl1 stability. The described robustness makes Ssl1 a potential candidate for industrial applications, preferably in processes that require alkaline reaction conditions.;,citation_author=Matthias Gunne;,citation_author=Vlada B.

In this study, we characterized BplMYB46, an MYB gene from Betula platyphylla (birch) that is involved in both abiotic stress tolerance and secondary wall biosynthesis. BplMYB46 can act as a transcriptional activator in yeast and tobacco. We generated transgenic birch plants with overexpressing or silencing of BplMYB46 and subjected them to gain- or loss-of-function analysis. The results suggest that BplMYB46 improves salt and osmotic tolerance by affecting the expression of genes including SOD, POD and P5CS to increase both reactive oxygen species scavenging and proline levels. In addition, BplMYB46 appears to be involved in controlling stomatal aperture to reduce water loss. Overexpression of BplMYB46 increases lignin deposition, secondary cell wall thickness and the expression of genes in secondary cell wall formation. Further analysis indicated that BplMYB46 binds to MYBCORE and AC-box motifs and may directly activate the expression of genes involved in abiotic stress responses and secondary cell wall biosynthesis whose promoters contain these motifs. The transgenic BplMYB46-overexpressing birch plants, which have improved salt and osmotic stress tolerance, higher lignin and cellulose content and lower hemicellulose content than the control, have potential applications in the forestry industry.;,citation_author=Huiyan Guo;,citation_author=Yucheng Wang;,citation_author=Liuqiang Wang;,citation_author=Ping Hu;,citation_author=Yanmin Wang;,citation_author=Yuanyuan Jia;,citation_author=Chunrui Zhang;,citation_author=Yu Zhang;,citation_author=Yiming Zhang;,citation_author=Chao Wang;,citation_author=Chuanping Yang;,citation_publication_date=2017;,citation_cover_date=2017;,citation_year=2017;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1111/pbi.12595;,citation_issn=14677652;,citation_pmid=27368149;,citation_volume=15;,citation_journal_title=Plant Biotechnol.

Second, vesselless wood ought to be exceptionally safe from cavitation if the small cumulative area of pits between tracheids confers safety (the pit area hypothesis). Data were obtained from branch wood of 19 vesselless angiosperms: Amborella trichopoda, Trochodendron aralioides, Tetracentron sinense, and 16 Winteraceae from Tasmannia, Zygogynum, Bubbia, Pseudowintera, and Drimys.

Low pit resistance was associated with greater pit membrane porosity inferred from scanning electron microscopy observations and silicone penetration and may represent incipient pit membrane loss.

In agreement with the pit area hypothesis, resistance to cavitation increased with decreasing total pit area between conduits.

Small total pit area between conduits may allow angiosperm tracheids to have more porous membranes for conducting efficiency without creating a cavitation problem.;,citation_author=U. G.

Here, we use a combination of low-temperature electronic absorption and magnetic circular dichroism, electron paramagnetic resonance, resonance Raman, and S K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopies to investigate a series of second-sphere variants–F114P, N47S, and F114N in Pseudomonas aeruginosa azurin–which modulate hydrogen bonding to and protein-derived dipoles nearby the Cu-S(Cys) bond. Density functional theory calculations correlated to the experimental data allow for the fractionation of the contributions to tuning E(0) into covalent and nonlocal electrostatic components. These are found to be significant, comparable in magnitude, and additive for active H-bonds, while passive H-bonds are mostly nonlocal electrostatic in nature. For dipoles, these terms can be additive to or oppose one another. This study provides a methodology for uncoupling covalency from nonlocal electrostatics, which, when coupled to X-ray crystallographic data, distinguishes specific local interactions from more long-range protein/active interactions, while affording further insight into the second-sphere mechanisms available to the protein to tune the E(0) of electron-transfer sites in biology.;,citation_author=Ryan G.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Intrinsic disorder in ubiquitination substrates;,citation_abstract=The ubiquitin–proteasome system is responsible for the degradation of numerous proteins in eukaryotes. Degradation is an essential process in many cellular pathways and involves the proteasome degrading a wide variety of unrelated substrates while retaining specificity in terms of its targets for destruction and avoiding unneeded proteolysis. How the proteasome achieves this task is the subject of intensive research. Many proteins are targeted for degradation by being covalently attached to a poly-ubiquitin chain. Several studies have indicated the importance of a disordered region for efficient degradation. Here, we analyze a data set of 482 in vivo ubiquitinated substrates and a subset in which ubiquitination is known to mediate degradation. We show that, in contrast to phosphorylation sites and other regulatory regions, ubiquitination sites do not tend to be located in disordered regions and that a large number of substrates are modified at structured regions. In degradation-mediated ubiquitination, there is a significant bias of ubiquitination sites to be in disordered regions; however, a significant number is still found in ordered regions. Moreover, in many cases, disordered regions are absent from ubiquitinated substrates or are located far away from the modified region. These surprising findings raise the question of how these proteins are successfully unfolded and ultimately degraded by the proteasome. They indicate that the folded domain must be perturbed by some additional factor, such as the p97 complex, or that ubiquitination may induce unfolding.;,citation_author=Tzachi Hagai;,citation_author=Ariel Azia;,citation_author=Ágnes Tóth-Petróczy;,citation_author=Yaakov Levy;,citation_publication_date=2011-09;,citation_cover_date=2011-09;,citation_year=2011;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.jmb.2011.07.024;,citation_issn=0022-2836;,citation_volume=412;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=J.

These rosettes have been observed previously in the PF face of the plasma membranes of a variety of cellulose-synthesizing cells and are thought to be important in cellulose synthesis. InZinnia tracheary elements, the rosettes are localized in the membrane over regions of secondary wall thickening and are absent between thickenings. The observation of rosettes in the Golgi cisternae and vesicles suggests that the Golgi apparatus is responsible for the selective transport and exocytosis of rosettes in higher plants, as has been previously indicated in the algaMicrasterias (Giddingset al. 1980). The data presented indicate that the Golgi apparatus has a critical role in the control of cell wall deposition because it is involved not only in the synthesis and export of matrix components but also in the export of an important component of the cellulose synthesizing apparatus. The rosettes are present in the plasma membrane and Golgi vesicles throughout the enlargement of the secondary thickening, suggesting that new rosettes must be continually inserted into the membrane to achieve complete cell wall thickening.;,citation_author=C.

Consistent with a block in CAD activity, antisense plants incorporate less cinnamyl alcohol monomers and more cinnamyl aldehyde monomers into lignin than corresponding control plants. Antisense plants with very low levels of CAD activity also show a novel phenotype with the appearance of a red-brown colour in xylem tissues. A similar phenotype is correlated with altered lignification and improved digestibility in brown-midrib mutants of maize and sorghum. The improved chemical extractability of lignin in CAD antisense plants supports a role for this technology in improving the pulp and paper-making value of forest trees while the similarity with brown-midrib mutants suggests a route to more digestibile forage crops.;,citation_author=Claire Halpin;,citation_author=Mary E.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Identification of cell-wall stress as a hexose-dependent and osmosensitive regulator of plant responses;,citation_abstract=Development, abiotic and biotic stress each affect the physical architecture and chemical composition of the plant cell wall, making maintenance of cell-wall integrity an important component of many plant processes. Cellulose biosynthesis inhibition (CBI) was employed to impair the functional integrity of the cell wall, and the plant’s response to this specific stress was characterized in an Arabidopsis seedling model system. CBI caused changes in the expression of genes involved in mechanoperception, the response to microbial challenge, and lignin and cell-wall polysaccharide biosynthesis. Following CBI, activation of a UDP-D-xylose 4-epimerase gene correlated with increases in arabinose and uronic acid content in seedling cell walls. Activation of pathogen response genes, lignin deposition and lesion formation were dependent on externally supplied sugars and were suppressed by osmotic support. Lignin deposition in the root elongation zone caused by CBI was reduced in atrbohd (NADPH oxidase) mutant seedlings but increased in jasmonic acid resistant1 (jar1-1) mutant seedlings. Phytohormone measurements showed that CBI-induced increases in jasmonic (JA) and salicylic acids were dependent on sugar availability and prevented by osmotic support. We show that CBI activates responses commonly attributed to both abiotic and microbial challenges. Glucose/sucrose and turgor pressure are critical components in maintenance of cell-wall integrity and the regulation of induced responses, including JA biosynthesis. Lignin deposition induced by CBI is regulated by JAR1-1 and NADPH oxidase-dependent signalling processes.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Ligninolysis by a purified lignin peroxidase;,citation_abstract=The lignin peroxidases (LiPs) of white-rot basidiomycetes are generally thought to catalyze the oxidative cleavage of polymeric lignin in vivo. However, direct evidence for such a role has been lacking. In this investigation, 14C- and 13C-labeled synthetic lignins were oxidized with a purified isozyme of Phanerochaete chrysosporium LiP. Gel permeation chromatography of the radiolabeled polymers showed that LiP catalyzed their cleavage to give soluble lower-M(r) products. To a lesser extent, the enzyme also polymerized the lignins to give soluble higher-M(r) products. This result is attributable to the fact that purified LiP, unlike the intact fungus, provides no mechanism for the removal of lignin fragments that are susceptible to repolymerization. LiP catalysis also gave small quantities of insoluble, perhaps polymerized, lignin, but in lower yield than intact P. chrysosporium does. 13C NMR experiments with 13C-labeled polymer showed that LiP cleaved it between C alpha and C beta of the propyl side chain to give benzylic aldehydes at C alpha, in agreement with the cleavage mechanism hypothesized earlier.

The lignin peroxidases (LiPs), manganese peroxidases (MnPs), and closely related enzymes of white rot basidiomycetes are likely contributors to fungal ligninolysis. Many of them cleave lignin model compounds to give products consistent with those found in residual white-rotted lignin, and at least some depolymerize synthetic lignins. However, none has yet been shown to delignify intact lignocellulose in vitro. The likely reason is that the peroxidases need to act in concert with small oxidants that can penetrate lignified tissues. Recent progress in the dissolution and NMR spectroscopy of plant cell walls may allow new inferences about the nature of the oxidants involved.

Here, we demonstrate dual roles of the WLIM1a gene in fiber development in upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum). WLIM1a is preferentially expressed during the elongation and secondary wall synthesis stages in developing fibers. Overexpression of WLIM1a in cotton led to significant changes in fiber length and secondary wall structure. Compared with the wild type, fibers of WLIM1a-overexpressing plants grew longer and formed a thinner and more compact secondary cell wall, which contributed to improved fiber strength and fineness. Functional studies demonstrated that (1) WLIM1a acts as an actin bundler to facilitate elongation of fiber cells and (2) WLIM1a also functions as a transcription factor to activate expression of Phe ammonia lyase–box genes involved in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis to build up the secondary cell wall. WLIM1a localizes in the cytosol and nucleus and moves into the nucleus in response to hydrogen peroxide. Taken together, these results demonstrate that WLIM1a has dual roles in cotton fiber development, elongation, and secondary wall formation. Moreover, our study shows that lignin/lignin-like phenolics may substantially affect cotton fiber quality; this finding may guide cotton breeding for improved fiber traits.;,citation_author=L.-B.

Primary cell walls are laid down around dividing and elongating cells and consist largely of the polysaccharides cellulose, hemicelluloses, and pectin along with approximately 10% protein. Specific cells such as xylem vessels and fibers lay down a secondary wall rich in cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, with lesser amounts of pectin. Most of the models depict the plant cell wall as a matrix of separate polysaccharides. However, the recent identification of a proteoglycan that contains covalently attached pectin and xylan indicates that at least some of these wall glycans exist as domains within a single glycopolymer and that current models of the wall need to be revised. Furthermore, several cell wall biosynthesis mutants, including the secondary cell wall mutant irregular xylem (irx) 8, are affected in multiple cell wall polymers making it challenging to define the biochemical function of the mutated gene. The goal of this review is to provide a background for studying genes which encode secondary cell wall biosynthetic proteins whose mutation affects multiple wall polymers including xylan and lignin. We first review the phenotypes of the irx mutants and then summarize the current understanding of the structure and synthesis of xylan and lignin along with a review of transcription factors known to affect secondary wall synthesis.

However, the mechanisms underlying compartmentalization remain unclear. Here we identified a novel structure that is indispensable for the establishment of compartments in cucumber GTs. Silica, a specialized compound, is deposited on the GTs and is visible on the surface of the fruit as a white powder, known as bloom. This deposition provides resistance against pathogens and prevents water loss from the fruits1. Using the cucumber bloomless mutant2, we discovered that a lignin-based cell wall structure in GTs, named “neck strip”, achieves compartmentalization by acting as an extracellular barrier crucial for the silica polymerization.

One is the difficulty of making new adenoviruses, and the second is the strong immunological reaction to viral proteins. Here we describe uses of Cre-lox recombination to overcome these problems. First, we demonstrate a simple method for constructing E1-substituted adenoviruses. Second, we demonstrate a method to construct adenovirus vectors carrying recombinant genes in place of all of the viral genes, so-called gutless adenovirus vectors. The pivotal feature in each method is the use of a negatively selected adenovirus named psi5. We engineered a cis-acting selection into psi5 by flanking its packaging site with loxP sites. When psi5 was grown in cells making a high level of Cre recombinase, the packaging site was deleted by recombination and the yield of psi5 was reduced to 5% of the wild-type level. To make a new E1-substituted virus, we used psi5 as a donor virus and recombined it with a shuttle vector via a loxP site. The resulting recombinant virus has a single loxP site next to the packaging site and therefore outgrows psi5 in the presence of Cre recombinase. To make a gutless virus, we used psi5 as a helper virus. The only viral sequences included in the gutless vector are those needed in cis for its replication and packaging. We found that a loxP site next to the packaging site of the gutless virus was necessary to neutralize homologous recombination between psi5 and the gutless viruses within their packaging domains.;,citation_author=S Hardy;,citation_author=M Kitamura;,citation_author=T Harris-Stansil;,citation_author=Y Dai;,citation_author=M L Phipps;,citation_publication_date=1997;,citation_cover_date=1997;,citation_year=1997;,citation_issue=3;,citation_isbn=0022-538X (Print){\textbackslash}r0022-538X (Linking);,citation_issn=0022-538X;,citation_pmid=9032314;,citation_volume=71;,citation_journal_title=J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Can Lignin Be Accurately Measured?;,citation_abstract=Forages serve an important role in providing nutrients to ruminants while providing positive benefits to the environment. Forage cell wall digestibility is incomplete because of several structural features within the wall, but digestion is mostly inversely correlated with the amount of lignification that has occurred during cell wall development. Lignin is a hydrophobic polymer formed through enzyme-mediated radical coupling of monolignols, mainly coniferyl and sinapyl alcohols. The polymer is highly resistant to degradation and generally passes through the ruminant unmodified. Though lignin is resistant to degradation, it is not easily quantified within various types of forages. Numerous methods have been developed over the years to measure lignin levels in different plant species. Most frequently used among workers involved with forage development or utilization are the acid detergent, Klason, and permanganate lignin methods. More recently, acetyl bromide has received attention as a possible lignin determination method. The acetyl bromide method is dependent on determining the absorbance of the extract in which all the lignin of a sample has been dissolved. Each of these methods gives different lignin values for the same type of forage sample. For example, acid detergent, Klason, permanganate, and acetyl bromide lignin methods give quite different values for alfalfa stems: 93, 145, 158, and 135 g lignin kgϪ1 cell wall, respectively. These differences can be even greater for grasses: 25, 77, 45, and 92 g kgϪ1 cell wall from corn (Zea mays L.) stalks analyzed by acid detergent, Klason, permanganate, and acetyl bromide lignin methods, respectively.

However, the dopamine-oxidizing activity was not inhibited by N-hydroxyglycine, while it was inhibited by phenylthiourea (PTU). Thus, the salivary glands of N. cincticeps contain two types of phenoloxidases: a laccase (85 kDa) and a phenoloxidase (200 kDa). Laccase activity was detected in a holidic sucrose diet that was fed on for 16 h by two females, but only a trace of catechol oxidase activity was observed, suggesting that the laccase-type phenoloxidase was the predominant phenoloxidase secreted in watery saliva. The laccase exhibited an optimum pH of 4.75-5 in McIlvaine buffer and had a PI of 4.8. Enzyme activity was histochemically localized in V cells of the posterior lobe of the salivary glands. It remained at the same level throughout the adult stage from 2 days after eclosion. A possible function of N. cincticeps salivary laccase may be rapid oxidization of potentially toxic monolignols to nontoxic polymers during feeding on the rice plant. This is the first report proving that laccase occurs in the salivary glands of Hemiptera species and is secreted in the watery saliva. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Rabbit polyclonal monospecific antibodies were raised against the recombinant SMT produced in Escherichia coli from the corresponding Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. cDNA. Immunoblot analysis of protein from different Arabidopsis tissues showed that the SMT is produced in all plant organs, except in the seeds and young seedlings. The enzyme was most abundant in older seedlings as well as in rosette leaves and the flowering stem of the plant. Minor amounts were found in the cauline leaves, flower buds and siliques. Traces were detected in the root and flowers. Arabidopsis and transgenic tobacco ( Nicotiana tabacum L.) plants expressing the full-length Arabidopsis SMT containing an N-terminal signal peptide showed apparent molecular masses of the protein of 52-55 kDa. The difference of ca. 8 kDa compared to the recombinant protein produced in E. coli was shown to be due to post-translational N-glycosylation of SMT in plants. Immunofluorescent labeling of Arabidopsis leaf sections localized SMT to the central vacuoles of mesophyll and epidermal cells. Comparable leaf sections of an SMT deletion mutant showed no vacuolar immunofluorescent labeling. We conclude that Arabidopsis SMT is synthesized as a precursor protein that is targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum where the signal peptide is removed. The correct N-terminus of the recombinantly produced SMT protein lacking the signal peptide was confirmed by Edman degradation. The protein is probably glycosylated in the Golgi apparatus from where it is subsequently routed to the vacuole.;,citation_author=Bettina Hause;,citation_author=Knut Meyer;,citation_author=Paul V.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Progressive drought alters architectural and anatomical traits of rice roots;,citation_abstract=BackgroundRoot architectural and anatomical phenotypes are important for adaptation to drought. Many rice-growing regions face increasing water scarcity. This study describes drought responses of 11 Egyptian rice cultivars with emphasis on plastic root responses that may enhance drought adaptation.ResultsEleven Egyptian rice cultivars were phenotyped for root architectural and anatomical traits after 6 weeks growth in soil mesocosms under well-watered conditions. Four of these cultivars were more intensively phenotyped under progressive drought stress in mesocosms, using a system where more moisture was available at depth than near the surface. In response to drought stress, all cultivars significantly reduced nodal root number while increasing large lateral root branching density and total lateral root length in the deepest portions of the mesocosm, where moisture was available. Nodal root cross-sectional area, but not stele area, was reduced by drought stress, especially in the basal segments of the root, and the number of late metaxylem vessels was reduced in only one cultivar. Alterations in deposition of lignin were detected by UV illumination from laser ablation tomography, enhanced by digital staining, and confirmed with standard histochemical methods. In well-watered plants, the sclerenchyma and endodermis were heavily lignified, and lignin was also visible throughout the epidermis and cortex. Under drought stress, very little lignin was detected in the outer cell layers and none in the cortex of nodal roots, but lignin deposition was enhanced in the stele. Root anatomical phenes, including cross-section area and metaxylem vessel number and lignin deposition varied dramatically along large lateral root axes under drought stress, with increasing diameter and less lignification of the stele in successive samples taken from the base to the root apex.ConclusionsRoot architectural and anatomical traits varied significantly among a set of Egyptian cultivars. Most traits were plastic, i.e. changed significantly with drought treatment, and, in many cases, plasticity was cultivar-dependent. These phenotypic alterations may function to enhance water uptake efficiency. Increased large lateral root branching in the deep soil should maintain water acquisition, while water transport during drought should be secured with a more extensively lignified stele.;,citation_author=Mohamed Hazman;,citation_author=Kathleen M.

In plant cells, cellulose synthesis is accomplished by cellulose synthase complexes located in the plasma membrane. Trafficking of the complex between endomembrane compartments and the plasma membrane is vital for cellulose biosynthesis; however, the mechanism for this process is not well understood. We here report that, in Arabidopsis thaliana, Rab-H1b, a Golgi-localized small GTPase, participates in the trafficking of CELLULOSE SYNTHASE 6 (CESA6) to the plasma membrane. Loss of Rab-H1b function resulted in altered distribution and motility of CESA6 in the plasma membrane and reduced cellulose content. Seedlings with this defect exhibited short, fragile etiolated hypocotyls. Exocytosis of CESA6 was impaired in rab-h1b cells, and endocytosis in mutant cells was significantly reduced as well. We further observed accumulation of vesicles around an abnormal Golgi apparatus having an increased number of cisternae in rab-h1b cells, suggesting a defect in cisternal homeostasis caused by Rab-H1b loss function. Our findings link Rab GTPases to cellulose biosynthesis, during hypocotyl growth, and suggest Rab-H1b is crucial for modulating the trafficking of cellulose synthase complexes between endomembrane compartments and the plasma membrane and for maintaining Golgi organization and morphology.;,citation_author=Ming He;,citation_author=Miao Lan;,citation_author=Baocai Zhang;,citation_author=Yihua Zhou;,citation_author=Youqun Wang;,citation_author=Lei Zhu;,citation_author=Ming Yuan;,citation_author=Ying Fu;,citation_publication_date=2018;,citation_cover_date=2018;,citation_year=2018;,citation_issue=11;,citation_doi=10.1111/jipb.12694;,citation_issn=1744-7909;,citation_volume=60;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=J.

The precise cross-links remain to be chemically identified both as network components in muro and as enzymic products generated in vitro with native extensin monomers as substrates. However, some extensin monomers contain variations within their putative cross-linking motifs that complicate cross-link identification. Other simpler extensins are recalcitrant to isolation including the ubiquitous P3-type extensin whose major repetitive motif, Hyp)4-Ser-Hyp-Ser-(Hyp)4-Tyr-Tyr-Tyr-Lys, is of particular interest, not least because its Tyr-Tyr-Tyr intramolecular isodityrosine cross-link motifs are also putative candidates for further intermolecular cross-linking to form di-isodityrosine. Therefore, we designed a set of extensin analogs encoding tandem repeats of the P3 motif, including Tyr \rightarrow Phe and Lys \rightarrow Leu variations. Expression of these P3 analogs in Nicotiana tabacum cells yielded glycoproteins with virtually all Pro residues hydroxylated and subsequently arabinosylated and with likely galactosylated Ser residues. This was consistent with earlier analyses of P3 glycopeptides isolated from cell wall digests and the predictions of the Hyp contiguity hypothesis. The tyrosine-rich P3 analogs also contained isodityrosine, formed in vivo. Significantly, these isodityrosine-containing analogs were further cross-linked in vitro by an extensin peroxidase to form the tetra-tyrosine intermolecular cross-link amino acid di-isodityrosine. This is the first identification of an inter-molecular cross-link amino acid in an extensin module and corroborates earlier suggestions that di-isodityrosine represents one mechanism for cross-linking extensins in muro.;,citation_author=Michael A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A Receptor-like Kinase Mediates the Response of Arabidopsis Cells to the Inhibition of Cellulose Synthesis;,citation_abstract=Background A major challenge is to understand how the walls of expanding plant cells are correctly assembled and remodeled, often in the presence of wall-degrading micro-organisms. Plant cells, like yeast, react to cell-wall perturbations as shown by changes in gene expression, accumulation of ectopic lignin, and growth arrest caused by the inhibition of cellulose synthesis. Results We have identified a plasma-membrane-bound receptor-like kinase (THESEUS1), which is present in elongating cells. Mutations in THE1 and overexpression of a functional THE1-GFP fusion protein did not affect wild-type (WT) plants but respectively attenuated and enhanced growth inhibition and ectopic lignification in seedlings mutated in cellulose synthase CESA6 without influencing the cellulose deficiency. A T-DNA insertion mutant for THE1 also attenuated the growth defect and ectopic-lignin production in other but not all cellulose-deficient mutants. The deregulation of a small number of genes in cesA6 mutants depended on the presence of THE1. Some of these genes are involved in pathogen defense, in wall crosslinking, or in protecting the cell against reactive oxygen species.

S-acylation promotes the association of proteins with membranes and influences protein stability, microdomain partitioning, membrane targeting and activation state. No consensus motif for S-acylation exists and it therefore requires empirical identification. Here, we describe a biotin switch isobaric tagging for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ)-based method to identify S-acylated proteins from Arabidopsis. We use these data to predict and confirm S-acylation of proteins not in our dataset. We identified c. 600 putative S-acylated proteins affecting diverse cellular processes. These included proteins involved in pathogen perception and response, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases (LRR-RLKs) and RLK superfamily members, integral membrane transporters, ATPases, soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor-activating protein receptors (SNAREs) and heterotrimeric G-proteins. The prediction of S-acylation of related proteins was demonstrated by the identification and confirmation of S-acylation sites within the SNARE and LRR-RLK families. We showed that S-acylation of the LRR-RLK FLS2 is required for a full response to elicitation by the flagellin derived peptide flg22, but is not required for localization to the plasma membrane.

The fusion lines showed equivalent or decreased height growth, stem biomass and total leaf area compared to the diploid line. The relative height increment of the fusion lines was not reduced compared to the diploid line when the plants were exposed to drought. The fusion lines were distinguished from the diploid counterpart by stomatal characteristics such as increased size and lower density. The changes in the stomatal apparatus did not affect the stomatal conductance. When exposed to drought the carbohydrate concentrations increased more strongly in the fusion lines than in the diploid line. Two fusion lines consumed significantly less water with regard to height growth, producing equivalent or increased relative stem biomass under drought compared to their diploid relative.

It is assumed that the PPO of chloroplast thylakoids and lamellae can be either latent or active depending upon specific cellular metabolism, plant treatment, and exposure conditions. Detergents, such as digitonin, accelerate tthe activation of spinach thylakoid membrane-bound PPO (Lieberei and Biehl, 1976). As any PPO activity localized by ultrastructural procedures, would be expected to possibly exist on the outer surfaces of the thylakoids and lamellae, a comprehensive methodology was defined for the isolation of sorbitol disrupted spinach chloroplast membranes, with subsequent ult ultrastructural localization of PPO (Henry et al., 1981). Spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) leaves were homogenized in 0.33M sorbitol-Hepes buffer, pH 7.6, followed by filtration through cheesecloth. 1) The filtrate was centrifuged at 300xg for 5 min. 2) The chloroplast pellet was then recentrifuged at 1,200xg for 10 min. The combined filtrates were layered on a discontinuous sucrose gradient and centrifuged at 20,000xg for 6 . Thirty separate 1-ml fractions were recentrifuged at 60,000xg for 20 min, giving individual pellets, each of which were prepared for ultastructural PPO enzyme localization (Henry et al., 1981). PPO is localized in the grana lamellae membranes of the sorbitol disrupted chloroplasts (Fig. 1), using 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) as the substrate. In the presence of the L-DOPA substrate, plus the PPO inhibitor, sodium diethyldithiocarbamate (DDC), the grana lamellae do not show a positive staining reaction for PPO (Fig. 2). There is also an absence of positive PPO staining in control tissue, lacking pretreatment with either L-DOPA or DDC (Fig. 3). To summarize, sorbitol-disrupted chlorolast membranes have been isolated via discontinuous sucrose density gradient centrifugaion and subsequently stained for the presence of PPO. The grana lamellae show positive PPO reaction product (Figs. 1-2). It is suggested that PPO is an integral part of the grana lamellae, even after sorbitol treatment; however, there is a release of a small amount of PPO into the soluble fractions (Henry et al., 1981).

Here the rhodanese-like domain (RHD) protein UbaC (HVO_1947) was found to copurify with the E1-like enzyme (UbaA) of the Ubl modification machinery in the archaeon Haloferax volcanii. UbaC was shown to be important for Ubl ligation, particularly for the attachment of the Ubl SAMP2/3s to protein targets after exposure to oxidants (NaOCl, dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO], and methionine sulfoxide [MetO]) and the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. While UbaC was needed for ligation of the Ubl SAMP1 to MoaE (the large subunit of molybdopterin synthase), it was not important in the formation of oxidant-induced SAMP1 protein conjugates. Indicative of defects in sulfur relay, mutation of ubaC impaired molybdenum cofactor (Moco)-dependent DMSO reductase activity and cell survival at elevated temperature, suggesting a correlation with defects in the 2-thiolated state of wobble uridine tRNA. Overall, the archaeal stand-alone RHD UbaC has an important function in Ubl ligation and is associated with sulfur relay processes. IMPORTANCE Canonical E2 Ub/Ubl-conjugating enzymes are not conserved in the dual-function Ubl systems associated with protein modification and sulfur relay. Instead, the C-terminal RHDs of E1-RHD fusion proteins are the apparent E2 modules of these systems in eukaryotes. E1s that lack an RHD are common in archaea. Here we identified an RHD (UbaC) that serves as an apparent E2 analog with the E1-like UbaA in the dual-function Ubl sampylation system of archaea. Unlike the eukaryotic E1-RHD fusion, the archaeal RHD is a stand-alone protein. This new insight suggests that E1 function in Ubl pathways could be influenced by shifts in RHD abundance and/or competition with other protein partners in the cell.;,citation_author=Nathaniel L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=LRR-extensins of vegetative tissues are a functionally conserved family of RALF1 receptors interacting with the receptor kinase FERONIA;,citation_abstract=Plant cell growth requires the coordinated expansion of the protoplast and the cell wall that confers mechanical stability to the cell. An elaborate system of cell wall integrity sensors monitors cell wall structures and conveys information on cell wall composition and growth factors to the cell. LRR-extensins (LRXs) are cell wall-attached extracellular regulators of cell wall formation and high-affinity binding sites for RALF (rapid alkalinization factor) peptide hormones that trigger diverse physiological processes related to cell growth. RALF peptides are also perceived by receptors at the plasma membrane and LRX4 of Arabidopsis thaliana has been shown to also interact with one of these receptors, FERONIA (FER). Here, we demonstrate that several LRXs, including the main LRX protein of root hairs, LRX1, interact with FER and RALF1 to coordinate growth processes. Membrane association of LRXs correlate with binding to FER, indicating that LRXs represent a physical link between intra- and extracellular compartments via interaction with membrane-localized proteins. Finally, despite evolutionary diversification of the LRR domains of various LRX proteins, many of them are functionally still overlapping, indicative of LRX proteins being central players in regulatory processes that are conserved in very different cell types. Author Summary Cell growth in plants requires the coordinated enlargement of the cell and the surrounding cell wall, which is ascertained by an elaborate system of cell wall integrity sensors, proteins involved in the exchange of information between the cell and the cell wall. In Arabidopsis thaliana, LRR-extensins (LRXs) are localized in the cell wall and are binding RALF peptides, hormones that regulate cell growth-related processes. LRX4 also binds the plasma membrane-localized receptor kinase FERONIA (FER), establishing a link between the cell and the cell wall. It is not clear, however, whether the different LRXs of Arabidopsis have similar functions and how they interact with their binding partners. Here, we demonstrate that interaction with FER and RALFs requires the LRR domain of LRXs and several but not all LRXs can bind these proteins. This explains the observation that mutations in several of the LRXs induce phenotypes comparable to a fer mutant, establishing that LRX-FER interaction is important for proper cell growth. Some LRXs, however, appear to influence cell growth processes in different ways, which remain to be identified.;,citation_author=Aline Herger;,citation_author=Shibu Gupta;,citation_author=Gabor Kadler;,citation_author=Christina Maria Franck;,citation_author=Aurélien Boisson-Dernier;,citation_author=Christoph Ringli;,citation_publication_date=2019-09;,citation_cover_date=2019-09;,citation_year=2019;,citation_doi=10.1101/783266;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_publisher=Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory;">

To sense the environment and status of cell wall structures, plants have evolved cell wall integrity-sensing mechanisms that involve a number of receptors at the plasma membrane. These receptors can bind cell wall components and/or hormones to coordinate processes in the cell wall and the cytoplasm. This review focuses on the role of leucine-rich repeat extensins (LRXs) during cell wall development. LRXs are chimeric proteins that insolubilize in the cell wall and form protein–protein interaction platforms. LRXs bind RALF peptide hormones that modify cell wall expansion and also directly interact with the transmembrane receptor FERONIA, which is involved in cell growth regulation. LRX proteins, therefore, also represent a link between the cell wall and plasma membrane, perceiving extracellular signals and indirectly relaying this information to the cytoplasm.;,citation_author=Aline Herger;,citation_author=Kai Dünser;,citation_author=Jürgen Kleine-Vehn;,citation_author=Christoph Ringli;,citation_publication_date=2019-09;,citation_cover_date=2019-09;,citation_year=2019;,citation_issue=17;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.cub.2019.07.039;,citation_issn=0960-9822;,citation_volume=29;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Curr.

Aspergillus nidulans cleistothecia are uniquely characterized by their dark red coloration and an envelope of thick-walled globose cells (hulle cells). By use of a new chromogenic substrate, we have shown that the constitutent hyphae of young cleistothecia and the hulle cells which surround the cleistothecia of A. nidulans exhibit a strong phenoloxidase activity which has the substrate specificity of a laccase. This enzyme (laccase II) is distinct from the previously described phenoloxidase (laccase I) that participates in the synthesis of the conidial pigment of A. nidulans: the two enzymes differ electrophoretically, do not cross-react immunologically, appear at different times during colonial development, and are under different genetic control. Examination of seven additional species of Aspergillus showed that the hulle cells of three acleistothecial species were also laccase positive, whereas the pale or unpigmented cleistothecia of four species (which lack hulle cells) were laccase negative. The relevance of these findings to the role of hulle cells in cleistothecial development is discussed. The presence of histologically detectable laccase in cleistothecial primordia provides a valuable tool, previously unavailable, for quantitating the early stages of sexual development in A. nidulans.;,citation_author=T.

The most important of these is the cationic peroxidase from Zinnia elegans (ZePrx), an enzyme considered to be responsible for the last step of lignification in this plant. Bibliographical evidence indicates that the arabidopsis peroxidase 72 (AtPrx72), which is homolog to ZePrx, could have an important role in lignification. For this reason, we performed a bioinformatic, histochemical, photosynthetic, and phenotypical and lignin composition analysis of an arabidopsis knock-out mutant of AtPrx72 with the aim of characterizing the effects that occurred due to the absence of expression of this peroxidase from the aspects of plant physiology such as vascular development, lignification, and photosynthesis. In silico analyses indicated a high homology between AtPrx72 and ZePrx, cell wall localization and probably optimal levels of translation of AtPrx72. The histochemical study revealed a low content in syringyl units and a decrease in the amount of lignin in the atprx72 mutant plants compared to WT. The atprx72 mutant plants grew more slowly than WT plants, with both smaller rosette and principal stem, and with fewer branches and siliques than the WT plants. Lastly, chlorophyll a fluorescence revealed a significant decrease in \PhiPSII and q L in atprx72 mutant plants that could be related to changes in carbon partitioning and/or utilization of redox equivalents in arabidopsis metabolism. The results suggest an important role of AtPrx72 in lignin biosynthesis.

Research on cell wall proteins (CWPs) is a challenging field since present knowledge of their role into the structure and function of cell walls is very incomplete. Among CWPs, hydroxyproline (Hyp)-rich O-glycoproteins (HRGPs) were classified into three categories: (i) moderately glycosylated extensins (EXTs) able to form covalent scaffolds; (ii) hyperglycosylated arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs); and (iii) Hyp/proline (Pro)-Rich proteins (H/PRPs) that may be non-, weakly- or highly-glycosylated. In this review, we provide a description of the main features of their post-translational modifications (PTMs), biosynthesis, structure and function. We propose a new model integrating HRGPs and their partners in cell walls.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Laccase/Mediator Systems: Their Reactivity toward Phenolic Lignin Structures;,citation_abstract=Laccase-mediator systems (LMS) have been widely studied for their capacity to oxidize the nonphenolic subunits of lignin (70–90% of the polymer). The phenolic subunits (10–30% of the polymer), which can also be oxidized without mediators, have received considerably less attention. Consequently, it remains unclear to what extent the presence of a mediator influences the reactions of the phenolic subunits of lignin. To get more insight in this, UHPLC-MS was used to study the reactions of a phenolic lignin dimer (GBG), initiated by a laccase from Trametes versicolor, alone or in combination with the mediators HBT and ABTS. The role of HBT was negligible, as its oxidation by laccase occurred slowly in comparison to that of GBG. Laccase and laccase/HBT oxidized GBG at a comparable rate, resulting in extensive polymerization of GBG. In contrast, laccase/ABTS converted GBG at a higher rate, as GBG was oxidized both directly by laccase but also by ABTS radical cations, which were rapidly formed by laccase. The laccase/ABTS system resulted in C\alpha oxidation of GBG and coupling of ABTS to GBG, rather than polymerization of GBG. Based on these results, we propose reaction pathways of phenolic lignin model compounds with laccase/HBT and laccase/ABTS.;,citation_author=Roelant Hilgers;,citation_author=Jean-Paul Vincken;,citation_author=Harry Gruppen;,citation_author=Mirjam A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Arabidopsis Cellulose Synthase Complex: A Proposed Hexamer of CESA Trimers in an Equimolar Stoichiometry;,citation_abstract=Cellulose is the most abundant renewable polymer on Earth and a major component of the plant cell wall. In vascular plants, cellulose synthesis is catalyzed by a large, plasma membrane-localized cellulose synthase complex (CSC), visualized as a hexameric rosette structure. Three unique cellulose synthase (CESA) isoforms are required for CSC assembly and function. However, elucidation of either the number or stoichiometry of CESAs within the CSC has remained elusive. In this study, we show a 1:1:1 stoichiometry between the three Arabidopsis thaliana secondary cell wall isozymes: CESA4, CESA7, and CESA8. This ratio was determined utilizing a simple but elegant method of quantitative immunoblotting using isoform-specific antibodies and 35S-labeled protein standards for each CESA. Additionally, the observed equimolar stoichiometry was found to be fixed along the axis of the stem, which represents a developmental gradient. Our results complement recent spectroscopic analyses pointing toward an 18-chain cellulose microfibril. Taken together, we propose that the CSC is composed of a hexamer of catalytically active CESA trimers, with each CESA in equimolar amounts.

We report the complete sequence of this 64-kDa protein, deduced from cDNA clones. The transit peptide has a chloroplast import signal at the N-terminus and a C-terminal hydrophobic span bounded by basic amino acids that predicts localization of the protein to the thylakoid lumen. The mature protein sequence is about 50% identical to several polyphenol oxidases (PPOs). Canonical protein kinase motifs are absent, as are sequences characteristic of ATP-binding sites. The mature protein resembles arthropodan hemocyanin (Hc), possessing three major domains. The N-terminal domain is rich in cysteine residues and predicted alpha-helices. The central domain has a conserved motif, N-terminal to a presumptive Cu-A site, that is not found in tyrosinases or Hc and is proposed as the provider of a third imidazole ligand to Cu-A.

Staining of differentiating compression wood demonstrated that laccase activity began in all cell wall layers before the onset of lignification. We detected no activity of peroxidase (another monolignol oxidase) in any cell wall layer. Thus, laccase likely plays the major role in monolignol oxidisation during compression wood differentiation. Laccase activity was higher in the S2 L region than in other secondary wall regions, suggesting that this enzyme was responsible for the high lignin concentration in this region of the cell wall. Immunolabelling demonstrated the expression of a compression-wood-specific laccase (CoLac1) immediately following the onset of secondary wall thickening, this enzyme was localised to the S2 L region, whereas much less abundant in the S1 layer or inner S2 layer.

TSET is non-essential in Dictyostelium, but may act in plasma membrane turnover, and is essentially identical to the recently described TPLATE complex, TPC. However, whereas TPC was reported to be plant-specific, we can identify a full or partial complex in every eukaryotic supergroup. An evolutionary path can be deduced from the earliest origins of the heterotetramer/scaffold coat to its multiple manifestations in modern organisms, including the mammalian muniscins, descendants of the TSET medium subunits. Thus, we have uncovered the machinery for an ancient and widespread pathway, which provides new insights into early eukaryotic evolution.;,citation_author=Jennifer Hirst;,citation_author=Alexander Schlacht;,citation_author=John P Norcott;,citation_author=David Traynor;,citation_author=Gareth Bloomfield;,citation_author=Robin Antrobus;,citation_author=Robert R Kay;,citation_author=Joel B Dacks;,citation_author=Margaret S Robinson;,citation_editor=W James Nelson;,citation_publication_date=2014-05;,citation_cover_date=2014-05;,citation_year=2014;,citation_doi=10.7554/eLife.02866;,citation_issn=2050-084X;,citation_volume=3;,citation_journal_title=eLife;,citation_publisher=eLife Sciences Publications, Ltd;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Altered pectin composition in primary cell walls of korrigan, a dwarf mutant of Arabidopsis deficient in a membrane-bound endo-1,4-\beta-glucanase;,citation_abstract=Korrigan (kor) is a dwarf mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. that is deficient in a membrane-bound endo-1,4-\beta-glucanase. The effect of the mutation on the pectin network has been studied in kor by microscopical techniques associated with various probes specific for different classes of pectic polysaccharides. The localisation of native crystalline cellulose was also examined using the cellobiohydrolase I-gold probe. The investigations were focused on the external cell walls of the epidermis, a cell layer that, in a number of plant species, has been shown to be growth limiting. Anionic sites associated with pectic polymers were quantified using the cationic gold probe. Homogalacturonans were quantified using polyclonal anti-polygalacturonic acid/rhamnogalacturonan I antibodies recognising polygalacturonic acid, and monoclonal JIM7 and JIM5 antibodies recognising homogalacturonans with a high or low degree of methyl-esterification, respectively. Rhamnogalacturonans were quantified with two monoclonal antibodies, LM5, recognising \beta-1,4 galactan side chains of rhamnogalacturonan I, and CCRCM2. Our results show a marked increase in homogalacturonan epitopes and a decrease in rhamnogalacturonan epitopes in kor compared to the wild type. A substantial decrease in cellobiohydrolase I-gold labelling was also observed in the mutant cell walls. These findings demonstrate that a deficiency in an endo-1,4-\beta-glucanase, which is in principle not directly implicated in pectin metabolism, can induce important changes in pectin composition in the primary cell wall. The changes indicate the existence of feedback mechanisms controlling the synthesis and/or deposition of pectic polysaccharides in primary cell walls.;,citation_author=Isabelle His;,citation_author=Azeddine Driouich;,citation_author=Frédéric Nicol;,citation_author=Alain Jauneau;,citation_author=Herman Höfte;,citation_publication_date=2001-02;,citation_cover_date=2001-02;,citation_year=2001;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1007/s004250000437;,citation_issn=1432-2048;,citation_volume=212;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Planta;">

However, their enzymatic conversion to fermentable sugars is detrimentally affected by lignins. Here the characterization of the Brachypodium Bd5139 mutant provided with a single nucleotide mutation in the caffeic acid O-methyltransferase BdCOMT6 gene is reported. This BdCOMT6-deficient mutant displayed a moderately altered lignification in mature stems. The lignin-related BdCOMT6 gene was also found to be expressed in grains, and the alterations of Bd5139 grain lignins were found to mirror nicely those evidenced in stem lignins. The Bd5139 grains displayed similar size and composition to the control. Complementation experiments carried out by introducing the mutated gene into the AtCOMT1-deficient Arabidopsis mutant demonstrated that the mutated BdCOMT6 protein was still functional.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Laccases and Peroxidases Co-Localize in Lignified Secondary Cell Walls throughout Stem Development;,citation_abstract=Lignin, a critical phenolic polymer in secondary cell walls of plant cells, enables strength in fibers and water transportation in xylem vessel elements. Secreted enzymes, namely laccases (LACs) and peroxidases (PRXs), facilitate lignin polymerization by oxidizing lignin monomers (monolignols). Previous work in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) demonstrated that AtLAC4 and AtPRX64 localized to discrete lignified cell wall domains in fibers, although the spatial distributions of other enzymes in these large gene families are unknown. Here, we show that characteristic sets of putative lignin-associated LACs and PRXs localize to precise regions during stem development, with LACs and PRXs co-occurring in cell wall domains. AtLAC4, AtLAC17, and AtPRX72 localized to the thick secondary cell wall of xylem vessel elements and fibers, whereas AtLAC4, AtPRX64, and AtPRX71 localized to fiber cell corners. Interestingly, AtLAC4 had a transient cell corner localization early in fiber development that disappeared in the mature stem. In contrast with these secondary cell wall localizations, AtLAC10, AtPRX42, AtPRX52, and AtPRX71 were found in nonlignified tissues. Despite ubiquitous PRX occurrence in cell walls, PRX oxidative activity was restricted to lignifying regions during development, which suggested regulated production of apoplastic hydrogen peroxide. Relative amounts of apoplastic reactive oxygen species differed between lignified cell types, which could modulate PRX activity. Together, these results indicate that precise localization of oxidative enzymes and differential distribution of oxidative substrates, such as hydrogen peroxide, provide mechanisms to control spatiotemporal deposition of lignin during development.;,citation_author=Natalie Hoffmann;,citation_author=Anika Benske;,citation_author=Heather Betz;,citation_author=Mathias Schuetz;,citation_author=A.

Cell wall composition varies among plant species, across cell types within a plant, within different regions of a single cell wall, and in response to intrinsic or extrinsic signals. This diversity in cell wall makeup is underpinned by common cellular mechanisms for cell wall production. Cellulose synthase complexes function at the plasma membrane and deposit their product into the cell wall. Matrix polysaccharides are synthesized by a multitude of glycosyltransferases in hundreds of mobile Golgi stacks, and an extensive set of vesicle trafficking proteins govern secretion to the cell wall.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Plant cell walls;,citation_abstract=Plants are able to generate large leaf surfaces that act as two-dimensional solar panels with a minimum investment in building material, thanks to a hydrostatic skeleton. This requires high intracellular pressures (up to 1 MPa), which depend on the presence of strong cell walls. The walls of growing cells (also called primary walls), are remarkably able to reconcile extreme tensile strength (up to 100 MPa) with the extensibility necessary for growth. All walled organisms are confronted with this dilemma — the need to balance strength and extensibility — and bacteria, fungi and plants have evolved independent solutions to cope. In this Primer, we discuss how plant cells have solved this problem, allowing them to support often very large increases in volume and to develop a broad variety of shapes (Figure 1A,B,D). This shape variation reflects the targeted deposition of wall material combined with local variations in cell-wall extensibility, processes that remain incompletely understood. Once the cell has reached its final size, it can lay down secondary wall layers, the composition and architecture of which are optimized to exert specific functions in different cell types (Figure 1E–G). Such functions include: providing mechanical support, for instance, for fibre cells in tree trunks or grass internodes; impermeabilising and strengthening vascular tissue to resist the negative pressure of the transpiration stream; increasing the surface area of the plasma membrane to facilitate solute exchange between cells (Figure 1C); or allowing important elastic deformation, for instance, to support the opening and closing of stomates. Specialized secondary walls, such as those constituting seed mucilage, are stored in a dehydrated form in seedcoat epidermis cells and show rapid swelling upon hydration of the seed. Other walls, in particular in reserve tissues, can accommodate large amounts of storage polysaccharides, which can be easily mobilized as a carbon source.

All monomers formed a polymeric material through enzymatic oxidation. The polymers displayed similar sizes by size exclusion chromatography analyses, but also exhibited some physical and chemical differences. The DHP made of coniferaldehyde had poorer solubility properties than the other DHPs, and through contact angle of water measurement on spin-coated surfaces of the polymeric materials, the DHPs made of coniferaldehyde and carboxylic ferulic acid exhibited higher hydrophobicity than the coniferyl alcohol DHP. A structural characterization with (13)C NMR revealed major differences between the coniferyl alcohol-based polymer and the coniferaldehyde/ferulic acid polymers, such as the predominance of aliphatic double bonds and the lack of certain benzylic structures in the latter cases.

This enzyme was further characterized by a determination of its apparent intracellular localization, pH optimum, substrate affinities, isoenzyme complement, response to inhibitors and apparent molecular weight. The substrate utilization profile at pH 6.1, the marked capability for oxidation of catecholamines and the nature of the effective inhibitors were all remarkably similar to those exhibited by the only other well studied, algal polyphenol oxidase, that of the marine green alga, Monostroma fuscum. The narrow preference of the charophyte enzyme for o-diphenols revealed that, like the polyphenol oxidase from M. fuscum, it possessed no cresolase or laccase activity. Differences between the enzyme from these freshwater and marine green algal sources were found with respect to pH optima obtained using certain substrates, capability for utilizing d-catechin and caffeic acid, and Michaelis constants for DOPA and catechol. Unlike the case for many polyphenol oxidases from higher plant sources, only a single cathodic form of the enzyme was resolved by electrophoresis.

This marks the first report of ferroxidase activity associated with a plant laccase and suggests that some members of this plant enzyme family may have physiological functions based on activities other than their more widely recognized phenoloxidase activity. Recent work with LMCOs from bacteria, yeast and mammals has shown that metal oxidase activities in these enzymes can be important for their primary physiological functions. With respect to ferroxidase activity in certain plant LMCOs, it is proposed that the high levels of LMCO expression in plant vascular tissues may reflect the need for high-efficiency iron uptake pumps in tissues that undergo lignification during normal development. Such iron uptake pumps would function to minimize levels of free iron so that reactive oxygen species do not reach toxic levels when H2O2is generated for peroxidase-mediated monolignol coupling during lignin deposition. © 2003 Elsevier SAS.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Dirigent domain-containing protein is part of the machinery required for formation of the lignin-based Casparian strip in the root.;,citation_abstract=The endodermis acts as a &amp;amp;amp;quot;second skin&amp;quot; in plant roots by providing the cellular control necessary for the selective entry of water and solutes into the vascular system. To enable such control, Casparian strips span the cell wall of adjacent endodermal cells to form a tight junction that blocks extracellular diffusion across the endodermis. This junction is composed of lignin that is polymerized by oxidative coupling of monolignols through the action of a NADPH oxidase and peroxidases. Casparian strip domain proteins (CASPs) correctly position this biosynthetic machinery by forming a protein scaffold in the plasma membrane at the site where the Casparian strip forms. Here, we show that the dirigent-domain containing protein, enhanced suberin1 (ESB1), is part of this machinery, playing an essential role in the correct formation of Casparian strips. ESB1 is localized to Casparian strips in a CASP-dependent manner, and in the absence of ESB1, disordered and defective Casparian strips are formed. In addition, loss of ESB1 disrupts the localization of the CASP1 protein at the casparian strip domain, suggesting a reciprocal requirement for both ESB1 and CASPs in forming the casparian strip domain.;,citation_author=Prashant S Hosmani;,citation_author=Takehiro Kamiya;,citation_author=John Danku;,citation_author=Sadaf Naseer;,citation_author=Niko Geldner;,citation_author=Mary Lou Guerinot;,citation_author=David E Salt;,citation_publication_date=2013;,citation_cover_date=2013;,citation_year=2013;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23940370\%5Cnhttp://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC3761638;,citation_issue=35;,citation_doi=10.1073/pnas.1308412110;,citation_isbn=1308362110;,citation_issn=1091-6490;,citation_pmid=23940370;,citation_volume=110;,citation_journal_title=Proc.

The Fe(III) heme states are modified upon Ca(2+) depletion, with an uncommon quantum mechanically mixed spin state becoming the dominant species. Ca(2+)-depleted HRPC forms complexes with benzohydroxamic acid and CO which display spectra very similar to those of native HRPC, indicating that any changes to the distal cavity structural properties upon Ca(2+) depletion are easily reversed. Contrary to the native protein, the Ca(2+)-depleted ferrous form displays a low-spin bis-histidyl heme state and a small proportion of high-spin heme. Furthermore, the nu(Fe-Im) stretching mode downshifts 27 cm(-1) upon Ca(2+) depletion revealing a significant structural perturbation of the proximal cavity near the histidine ligand. The specific activity of the Ca(2+)-depleted enzyme is 50% that of the native form. The effects on enzyme activity and spectral features observed upon Ca(2+) depletion are reversible upon reconstitution. Evaluation of the present and previous data firmly favors the proximal Ca(2+) ion as that which is lost upon Ca(2+) depletion and which likely plays the more critical role in regulating the heme pocket structural and catalytic properties.;,citation_author=Barry D.

In plants, import has to further discriminate between mitochondria and chloroplasts. In this study, we determined the precise cleavage sites in the presequences for Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice (Oryza sativa) mitochondrial proteins using mass spectrometry by comparing the precursor sequences with experimental evidence of the amino-terminal peptide from mature proteins. We validated this method by assessments of false-positive rates and comparisons with previous available data using Edman degradation. In total, the cleavable presequences of 62 proteins from Arabidopsis and 52 proteins from rice mitochondria were determined. None of these proteins contained amino-terminal acetylation, in contrast to recent findings for chloroplast stromal proteins. Furthermore, the classical matrix glutamate dehydrogenase was detected with intact and amino-terminal acetylated sequences, indicating that it is imported into mitochondria without a cleavable targeting signal. Arabidopsis and rice mitochondrial presequences had similar isoelectric points, hydrophobicity, and the predicted ability to form an amphiphilic alpha-helix at the amino-terminal region of the presequence, but variations in length, amino acid composition, and cleavage motifs for mitochondrial processing peptidase were observed. A combination of lower hydrophobicity and start point of the amino-terminal alpha-helix in mitochondrial presequences in both Arabidopsis and rice distinguished them (98%) from Arabidopsis chloroplast stroma transit peptides. Both Arabidopsis and rice mitochondrial cleavage sites could be grouped into three classes, with conserved -3R (class II) and -2R (class I) or without any conserved (class III) arginines. Class II was dominant in both Arabidopsis and rice (55%-58%), but in rice sequences there was much less frequently a phenylalanine (F) in the -1 position of the cleavage site than in Arabidopsis sequences.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Enhanced fluorescence of chitosan based on size change of micelles and application to directly selective detecting Fe3+ in human serum;,citation_abstract=In this paper, we have developed an approach to significantly enhance fluorescence of chitosan by simply heated the inherently low fluorescent chitosan aqueous solution. Enhanced blue fluorescence of chitosan solution was observed as originated from the formation of small size of chitosan micelle after long time heated. The fluorescence of chitosan micelles was quenched and recovered when Fe3+ ions were combined and released from chitosan micelles. Therefore, chitosan without modification of functional groups can recognize Fe3+ with very high selectivity. As a result, a new fluorescence sensor for sensitively detecting Fe3+ ion based on the change of chitosan micelles sizes was subsequently fabricated. This enhanced fluorescence enables the chitosan sensor to be sensitive to low concentrations of Fe3+, and it is linear responsive in the range of 1.9610-8 to 2.0010-5M. Importantly, this novel sensor may be applied in human serum for direct detection of Fe3+ ion without sample pretreatment. Analysis of 5 samples of human serum shows that the average concentration of Fe3+ is 26.95\muM, which is consistent with the results determined by other methods. Moreover, the advantage of chitosan-based assay is that Fe3+ rather than Fe2+ in human serum can be directly measured, avoiding costly, time-consuming and complex process. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.;,citation_author=Haowen Huang;,citation_author=Fang Liu;,citation_author=Shenna Chen;,citation_author=Qian Zhao;,citation_author=Bo Liao;,citation_author=Yunfei Long;,citation_author=Yunlong Zeng;,citation_author=Xiaodong Xia;,citation_publication_date=2013;,citation_cover_date=2013;,citation_year=2013;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.bios.2012.10.098;,citation_isbn=0956-5663;,citation_issn=09565663;,citation_pmid=23261686;,citation_volume=42;,citation_journal_title=Biosens.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Rice (Oryza sativa) Laccases Involved in Modification and Detoxification of Herbicides Atrazine and Isoproturon Residues in Plants;,citation_abstract=Atrazine (ATR) and isoproturon (IPU) as herbicides have become serious environmental contaminants due to their overuse in crop production. Although ATR and IPU in soils are easily absorbed by many crops, the mechanisms for their degradation or detoxification in plants are poorly understood. This study identified a group of novel genes encoding laccases (EC 1.10.3.2) that are possibly involved in catabolism or detoxification of ATR and IPU residues in rice. Transcriptome profiling shows at least 22 differentially expressed laccase genes in ATR/IPU-exposed rice. Some of the laccase genes were validated by RT-PCR analysis. The biochemical properties of the laccases were analyzed, and their activities in rice were induced under ATR/IPU exposure. To investigate the roles of laccases in degrading or detoxifying ATR/IPU in rice, transgenic yeast cells (Pichia pastoris X-33) expressing two rice laccase genes (LOC-Os01g63180 and LOC-Os12g15680) were generated. Both transformants were found to accumulate less ATR/IPU compared to the control. The ATR/IPU-degraded products in the transformed yeast cells using UPLC-TOF-MS/MS were further characterized. Two metabolites, hydroxy-dehydrogenated atrazine (HDHA) and 2-OH-isopropyl-IPU, catalyzed by laccases were detected in the eukaryotic cells. These results indicate that the laccase-coding genes identified here could confer degradation or detoxification of the herbicides and suggest that the laccases could be one of the important enzymatic pathways responsible for ATR/IPU degradation/detoxification in rice. © 2016 American Chemical Society.;,citation_author=Meng Tian Huang;,citation_author=Yi Chen Lu;,citation_author=Shuang Zhang;,citation_author=Fang Luo;,citation_author=Hong Yang;,citation_publication_date=2016;,citation_cover_date=2016;,citation_year=2016;,citation_issue=33;,citation_doi=10.1021/acs.jafc.6b02187;,citation_issn=15205118;,citation_volume=64;,citation_journal_title=J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Endosidin20 Targets the Cellulose Synthase Catalytic Domain to Inhibit Cellulose Biosynthesis[OPEN];,citation_abstract=Plant cellulose is synthesized by rosette-structured cellulose synthase (CESA) complexes (CSCs). Each CSC is composed of multiple subunits of CESAs representing three different isoforms. Individual CESA proteins contain conserved catalytic domains for catalyzing cellulose synthesis, other domains such as plant-conserved sequences, and class-specific regions that are thought to facilitate complex assembly and CSC trafficking. Because of the current lack of atomic-resolution structures for plant CSCs or CESAs, the molecular mechanism through which CESA catalyzes cellulose synthesis and whether its catalytic activity influences efficient CSC transport at the subcellular level remain unknown. Here, by performing chemical genetic analyses, biochemical assays, structural modeling, and molecular docking, we demonstrate that Endosidin20 (ES20) targets the catalytic site of CESA6 in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Chemical genetic analysis revealed important amino acids that potentially participate in the catalytic activity of plant CESA6, in addition to previously identified conserved motifs across kingdoms. Using high spatiotemporal resolution live cell imaging, we found that inhibiting the catalytic activity of CESA6 by ES20 treatment reduced the efficiency of CSC transport to the plasma membrane. Our results demonstrate that ES20 is a chemical inhibitor of CESA activity and trafficking that represents a powerful tool for studying cellulose synthesis in plants.;,citation_author=Lei Huang;,citation_author=Xiaohui Li;,citation_author=Weiwei Zhang;,citation_author=Nolan Ung;,citation_author=Nana Liu;,citation_author=Xianglin Yin;,citation_author=Yong Li;,citation_author=Robert E.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Endosidin20-1 is more potent than Endosidin20 in inhibiting plant cellulose biosynthesis and molecular docking analysis of cellulose biosynthesis inhibitors on modeled cellulose synthase structure;,citation_abstract=Endosidin20 (ES20) is a recently identified cellulose biosynthesis inhibitor (CBI) that targets the catalytic site of plant cellulose synthase (CESA). Here, we screened over 600 ES20 analogs and identified nine active analogs named ES20-1 to ES20-9. Among these, endosidin20-1 (ES20-1) had stronger inhibitory effects on plant growth and cellulose biosynthesis than ES20. At the biochemical level, we demonstrated that ES20-1, like ES20, directly interacts with CESA6. At the cellular level, this molecule, like ES20, induced the accumulation of cellulose synthase complexes at the Golgi apparatus and inhibited their secretion to the plasma membrane. Like ES20, ES20-1 likely targets the catalytic site of CESA. However, through molecular docking analysis using a modeled structure of full-length CESA6, we found that both ES20 and ES20-1 might have another target site at the transmembrane regions of CESA6. Besides ES20, other CBIs such as isoxaben, C17, and flupoxam are widely used tools to dissect the mechanism of cellulose biosynthesis and are also valuable resources for the development of herbicides. Here, based on mutant genetic analysis and molecular docking analysis, we have identified the potential target sites of these CBIs on a modeled CESA structure. Some bacteria also produce cellulose, and both ES20 and ES20-1 inhibited bacterial cellulose biosynthesis. Therefore, we conclude that ES20-1 is a more potent analog of ES20 that inhibits intrinsic cellulose biosynthesis in plants, and both ES20 and ES20-1 show an inhibitory effect on bacterial growth and cellulose synthesis, making them excellent tools for exploring the mechanisms of cellulose biosynthesis across kingdoms.;,citation_author=Lei Huang;,citation_author=Xiaohui Li;,citation_author=Chunhua Zhang;,citation_publication_date=2021;,citation_cover_date=2021;,citation_year=2021;,citation_issue=6;,citation_doi=10.1111/tpj.15258;,citation_issn=1365-313X;,citation_volume=106;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Plant J.;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The catalytic domain of cellulose synthase (CESA) is involved in vesicle trafficking and protein dynamics;,citation_abstract=Cellulose, as the main component of the plant cell wall, is synthesized by a multimeric protein complex named the cellulose synthase (CESA) complex or CSC. In plant cells, CSCs are transported through the endomembrane system to the PM, but how catalytic activity or conserved motifs around the catalytic core domain influence vesicle trafficking or protein dynamics is not well understood. Here, we used a functional YFP-tagged AtCESA6 and site-directed mutagenesis to create 18 single amino acid replacement mutants in key motifs of the catalytic domain including DDG, DXD, TED and QXXRW, to comprehensively analyze how catalytic activity affects plant growth, cellulose biosynthesis, as well as CSC dynamics and trafficking. Plant growth and cellulose content were reduced by nearly all mutations. Moreover, mutations in most conserved motifs reduced the velocity of CSC movement in the PM as well as delivery of CSCs to the PM. Interestingly, the abundance of YFP-CESA6 in the Golgi apparatus was increased or reduced by mutations in DDG and QXXRW motifs, respectively. Post-Golgi trafficking of CSCs was also differentially perturbed by these mutations and, based on these phenotypes, the 18 mutants could be divided into two major groups. Group I comprises mutations causing significantly increased Golgi fluorescence intensity with either an increase or no change in the abundance of cortical SmaCCs compared with wild-type. In contrast, Group II represents mutations with significantly decreased Golgi fluorescence intensity and/or reduced SmaCC density. We propose that Group I mutations cause CSC trafficking defects whereas Group II mutations affect normal CSC rosette formation and hence interfere with subsequent CSC trafficking. Collectively, our results demonstrate that the catalytic domain of CESA6 is essential not only for cellulose biosynthesis, but also complex formation, protein folding and dynamics, vesicle trafficking, or all of the above.;,citation_author=Lei Huang;,citation_author=Weiwei Zhang;,citation_author=Xiaohui Li;,citation_author=Christopher J.

Key to these different functionalities are characteristic structural arrangements and chemical modifications of the underlying sclerenchymatous tissues. Although many ecological aspects of hard seed encapsulation have been well documented, a detailed understanding of the relationship between tissue structure and function only recently started to emerge, especially in the context of environmentally driven fruit opening and seed dispersal (responsive encapsulations) and the outstanding durability of some seed coats and indehiscent fruits (static encapsulations).

Endocarp sclerification also occurs in many land plants with large seeds; however, in T. natans, the processes of fruit formation, endocarp hardening, and seed storage take place entirely underwater. To identify potential chemical and structural adaptations for the aquatic environment, we investigated the cell-wall composition in the endocarp at a young developmental stage, as well as at fruit maturity. Our work shows that hydrolyzable tannins—specifically gallotannins—flood the endocarp tissue during secondary wall formation and are integrated into cell walls along with lignin during maturation. Within the secondary walls of mature tissue, we identified unusually strong spectroscopic features of ester linkages, suggesting that the gallotannins and their derivatives are cross-linked to other wall components via ester bonds, leading to unique cell-wall properties. The synthesis of large amounts of water-soluble, defensive aromatic metabolites during secondary wall formation might be a fast way to defend seeds within the insufficiently lignified endocarp of T. natans.;,citation_author=Jessica C Huss;,citation_author=Sebastian J Antreich;,citation_author=Martin Felhofer;,citation_author=Konrad Mayer;,citation_author=Michaela Eder;,citation_author=Ana Catarina Vieira Dias dos Santos;,citation_author=Georg Ramer;,citation_author=Bernhard Lendl;,citation_author=Notburga Gierlinger;,citation_publication_date=2024-01;,citation_cover_date=2024-01;,citation_year=2024;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1093/plphys/kiad408;,citation_issn=0032-0889;,citation_volume=194;,citation_journal_title=Plant Physiol.;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Apoplastic pH and Ammonium Concentration in Leaves of Brassica napus L;,citation_abstract=A vacuum infiltration technique was developed that enabled the extraction of apoplastic solution with very little cytoplasmic contamination as evident from a malate dehydrogenase activity of less than 1% in the apoplastic solution relative to that in bulk leaf extracts. The volume of apoplastic water, a prerequisite for determination of the concentration of apoplastic solutes, was determined by vacuum infiltration of indigo carmine with subsequent analysis of the dilution of the dye in apoplastic extracts. Indigo carmine was neither transported across the cell membrane nor significantly adsorbed to the cell walls, ensuring reproducible (SE &amp;amp;amp;lt; 2%) and precise determination of apoplastic water. Analysis of leaves from four different positions on senescing Brassica napus plants showed a similar apoplastic pH of 5.8, while apoplastic NH4+ increased from 1.1 mM in lower leaves to 1.3 mM in upper leaves. Inhibition of glutamine synthetase in young B. napus plants resulted in increasing apoplastic pH from 6.0 to 6.8 and increasing apoplastic NH4+ concentration from 1.0 to 25.6 mM, followed by a marked increase in NH3 emission. Calculating NH3 compensation points for B. napus plants on the basis of measured apoplastic H+ and NH4+ concentrations gave values ranging from 4.3 to 5.9 nmol NH3 mol-1 air, consistent with an estimate of 5.3 [plus or minus] 3.6 nmol NH3 mol-1 air obtained by NH3 exchange experiments in growth chambers. A strong linear relationship was found between calculated NH3 compensation points and measured NH3 emission rates in glutamine synthetase-inhibited plants.;,citation_author=S.

Sugi heartwood tissue generated secondary ions that were not produced from sapwood tissue by TOF-SIMS. Among the peculiar ions generated from heartwood, two positive ions of m/z 285 and 301 were remarkable due to their appearance in a larger mass range and with a high intensity. These two ions were not generated from heartwood tissue preextracted with n-hexane, and the n-hexane extract of Sugi heartwood produced both ions. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of the n-hexane extract demonstrated that ferruginol, a diterpene phenol, the molecular weight of which is 286, constituted one of the predominant constituents of the extract. Authentic ferruginol also generated both ions by TOF-SIMS. The molecular formula of the m/z 285 ion generated from Sugi heartwood tissue was estimated to be C20H29O, which corresponds well with that of ferruginol, i.e. C20H30O, by peak identification. All these results strongly suggest that the m/z 285 ion generated from Sugi heartwood tissue originated significantly from ferruginol in Sugi heartwood. By TOF-SIMS imaging, the m/z 285 ion was detected uniformly in the tracheid cell walls, in the cell walls of the axial parenchyma cells and ray parenchyma cells, and also inside these parenchyma cells.

These results indicated that living non-TE cells, probably xylem parenchyma cells, secrete some kinds of phenylpropanoids via a vesicle transport system.

Within flowering plants, pollen development occurs inside of the anther. Here, we report the identification of two class III peroxidase-encoding genes, PEROXIDASE9 (PRX9) and PRX40, that are genetically redundant and essential for proper anther and pollen development in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Arabidopsis double mutants devoid of functional PRX9 and PRX40 are male sterile. The mutant anthers display swollen, hypertrophic tapetal cells and pollen grains, suggesting disrupted cell wall integrity. These phenotypes lead to nearly 100%-penetrant pollen degeneration upon anther maturation. Using immunochemical and biochemical approaches, we show that PRX9 and PRX40 likely cross-link extensins to contribute to tapetal cell wall integrity during anther development.

In maize coleoptiles, free space pH begins to fall within about 12 minutes of exposure to auxin and decreases by about 1 pH unit by approximately 30 minutes. In pea, pH begins to decrease within an average of 15 to 18 minutes of exposure to auxin and falls by about 0.9 pH unit by approximately 40 minutes. Auxin-stimulated elongation, measured in the same two tissues similarly prepared, appears in maize at the earliest 18 minutes after auxin application, while in pea it appears at the earliest 21 to 24 minutes after auxin application. The auxin analogs p-chlorophenoxyisobutyric acid and phenylacetic acid do not stimulate elongation above control levels in maize or pea tissue segments and do not cause a decrease in free space pH in either tissue.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Do Xylem Fibers Affect Vessel Cavitation Resistance?;,citation_abstract=Possible mechanical and hydraulic costs to increased cavitation resistance were examined among six co-occurring species of chaparral shrubs in southern California. We measured cavitation resistance (xylem pressure at 50% loss of hydraulic conductivity), seasonal low pressure potential (P(min)), xylem conductive efficiency (specific conductivity), mechanical strength of stems (modulus of elasticity and modulus of rupture), and xylem density. At the cellular level, we measured vessel and fiber wall thickness and lumen diameter, transverse fiber wall and total lumen area, and estimated vessel implosion resistance using (t/b)(h)(2), where t is the thickness of adjoining vessel walls and b is the vessel lumen diameter. Increased cavitation resistance was correlated with increased mechanical strength (r(2) = 0.74 and 0.76 for modulus of elasticity and modulus of rupture, respectively), xylem density (r(2) = 0.88), and P(min) (r(2) = 0.96). In contrast, cavitation resistance and P(min) were not correlated with decreased specific conductivity, suggesting no tradeoff between these traits. At the cellular level, increased cavitation resistance was correlated with increased (t/b)(h)(2) (r(2) = 0.95), increased transverse fiber wall area (r(2) = 0.89), and decreased fiber lumen area (r(2) = 0.76).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Barley DNA-binding methionine aminopeptidase, which changes the localization from the nucleus to the cytoplasm by low temperature, is involved in freezing tolerance;,citation_abstract=The polymerase chain reaction-based Mirror Orientation Selection (MOS) method was used to isolate low temperature-induced genes from cold-treated winter barley (Hordeum vulgare L. cv. Dongbori). MOS screening identified a novel methionine (Met) aminopeptidase (MAP) designated as HvMAP. The deduced HvMAP protein was determined to possess an aminopeptidase domain and a nuclear localization signal. An in vitro enzyme assay using recombinant HvMAP protein demonstrated MAP activity. The expression of this gene was induced by low temperature and abscisic acid treatment, and overexpression of this gene conferred stronger freezing tolerance to Arabidopsis transgenic plants as compared to wild-type plants. Interestingly, low temperature treatment changed the localization of HvMAP from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. These findings suggest that HvMAP is a novel MAP that functions in freezing tolerance by facilitating protein maturation. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.;,citation_author=Hee Jeong Jeong;,citation_author=Jeong Sheop Shin;,citation_author=Sung Han Ok;,citation_publication_date=2011;,citation_cover_date=2011;,citation_year=2011;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.plantsci.2010.09.004;,citation_isbn=0168-9452;,citation_issn=01689452;,citation_pmid=21421347;,citation_volume=180;,citation_journal_title=Plant Sci.;,citation_publisher=Elsevier Ireland Ltd;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Modification of Leaf Apoplastic pH in Relation to Stomatal Sensitivity to Root-Sourced Abscisic Acid Signals;,citation_abstract=The confocal microscope was used to determine the pH of the leaf apoplast and the pH of microvolumes of xylem sap. We quantified variation in leaf apoplast and sap pH in relation to changes in edaphic and atmospheric conditions that impacted on stomatal sensitivity to a root-sourced abscisic acid signal. Several plant species showed significant changes in the pH of both xylem sap and the apoplast of the shoot in response to environmental perturbation. Xylem sap leaving the root was generally more acidic than sap in the midrib and the apoplast of the leaf. Increasing the transpiration rate of both intact plants and detached plant parts resulted in more acidic leaf apoplast pHs. Experiments with inhibitors suggested that protons are removed from xylem sap as it moves up the plant, thereby alkalinizing the sap. The more rapid the transpiration rate and the shorter the time that the sap resided in the xylem/apoplastic pathway, the smaller the impact of proton removal on sap pH. Sap pH of sunflower (Helianthus annuus) and Commelina communis did not change significantly as soil dried, while pH of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) sap increased as water availability in the soil declined. Increasing the availability of nitrate to roots also significantly alkalinized the xylem sap of tomato plants. This nitrogen treatment had the effect of enhancing the sensitivity of the stomatal response to soil drying. These responses were interpreted as an effect of nitrate addition on sap pH and closure of stomata via an abscisic acid-based mechanism.;,citation_author=Wensuo Jia;,citation_author=William John Davies;,citation_publication_date=2007-01;,citation_cover_date=2007-01;,citation_year=2007;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1104/pp.106.089110;,citation_issn=0032-0889;,citation_volume=143;,citation_journal_title=Plant Physiol.;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Chitinase-Like1 Plays a Role in Stalk Tensile Strength in Maize1;,citation_abstract=Stalk lodging in maize (Zea mays) causes significant yield losses due to breaking of stalk tissue below the ear node before harvest. Here, we identified the maize brittle stalk4 (bk4) mutant in a Mutator F2 population. This mutant was characterized by highly brittle aerial parts that broke easily from mechanical disturbance or in high-wind conditions. The bk4 plants displayed a reduction in average stalk diameter and mechanical strength, dwarf stature, senescence at leaf tips, and semisterility of pollen. Histological studies demonstrated a reduction in lignin staining of cells in the bk4 mutant leaves and stalk, and deformation of vascular bundles in the stalk resulting in the loss of xylem and phloem tissues. Biochemical characterization showed a significant reduction in p-coumaric acid, Glc, Man, and cellulose contents. The candidate gene responsible for bk4 phenotype is Chitinase-like1 protein (Ctl1), which is expressed at its highest levels in elongated internodes. Expression levels of secondary cell wall cellulose synthase genes (CesA) in the bk4 single mutant, and phenotypic observations in double mutants combining bk4 with bk2 or null alleles for two CesA genes, confirmed interaction of ZmCtl1 with CesA genes. Overexpression of ZmCtl1 enhanced mechanical stalk strength without affecting plant stature, senescence, or fertility. Biochemical characterization of ZmCtl1 overexpressing lines supported a role for ZmCtl1 in tensile strength enhancement.

Despite increasing knowledge of MAT regulation at transcriptional levels, how MAT is post-translationally regulated remains unknown in plant cells. Phosphorylation is an important post-translational modification for regulating the activity of enzymes, protein function and signaling transduction. Using molecular and biochemical approaches, we have identified the phosphorylation of MAT proteins by calcium-dependent protein kinase (CPK28). Phenotypically, both MAT2-overexpressing transgenic plants and cpk28 mutants display short hypocotyls and ectopic lignifications. Their shortened hypocotyl phenotypes are caused by ethylene overproduction and rescued by ethylene biosynthesis inhibitor aminoethoxyvinylglycine treatment. Genetic evidence reveals that MAT2 mutation restores the phenotype of ectopic lignification in CPK28-deficient plants. We find that total MAT proteins and AdoMet are increased in cpk28 mutants, but decreased in CPK28-overexpressing seedlings. We also find that MATs in OE::CPK28 are degraded through the 26S proteasome pathway. Our work suggests that CPK28 targets MATs (MAT1, MAT2 and MAT3) for degradation by the 26S proteasome pathway, and thus affects ethylene biosynthesis and lignin deposition in Arabidopsis.;,citation_author=Yu Jin;,citation_author=Nenghui Ye;,citation_author=Fuyuan Zhu;,citation_author=Haoxuan Li;,citation_author=Juan Wang;,citation_author=Liwen Jiang;,citation_author=Jianhua Zhang;,citation_publication_date=2017;,citation_cover_date=2017;,citation_year=2017;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1111/tpj.13493;,citation_isbn=1365-313X (Electronic) 0960-7412 (Linking);,citation_issn=1365313X;,citation_pmid=28112445;,citation_volume=90;,citation_journal_title=Plant J.;">

Manual (i.e., user) baseline determination and removal is a common technique used to perform this operation. Currently, little data exists that details the accuracy and precision that can be expected with manual baseline removal techniques. This study addresses this current lack of data. One hundred spectra of varying signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), signal-to-baseline ratio (SBR), baseline slope, and spectral congestion were constructed and baselines were subtracted by 16 volunteers who were categorized as being either experienced or inexperienced in baseline determination. In total, 285 baseline determinations were performed. The general level of accuracy and precision that can be expected for manually determined baselines from spectra of varying SNR, SBR, baseline slope, and spectral congestion is established. Furthermore, the effects of user experience on the accuracy and precision of baseline determination is estimated. The interactions between the above factors in affecting the accuracy and precision of baseline determination is highlighted. Where possible, the functional relationships between accuracy, precision, and the given spectral characteristic are detailed.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Characteristics of Cellulose Nanofibrils from Transgenic Trees with Reduced Expression of Cellulose Synthase Interacting 1;,citation_abstract=Cellulose nanofibrils can be derived from the native load-bearing cellulose microfibrils in wood. These microfibrils are synthesized by a cellulose synthase enzyme complex that resides in the plasma membrane of developing wood cells. It was previously shown that transgenic hybrid aspen trees with reduced expression of CSI1 have different wood mechanics and cellulose microfibril properties. We hypothesized that these changes in the native cellulose may affect the quality of the corresponding nanofibrils. To test this hypothesis, wood from wild-type and transgenic trees with reduced expression of CSI1 was subjected to oxidative nanofibril isolation. The transgenic wood-extracted nanofibrils exhibited a significantly lower suspension viscosity and estimated surface area than the wild-type nanofibrils. Furthermore, the nanofibril networks manufactured from the transgenics exhibited high stiffness, as well as reduced water uptake, tensile strength, strain-to-break, and degree of polymerization. Presumably, the difference in wood properties caused by the decreased expression of CSI1 resulted in nanofibrils with distinctive qualities. The observed changes in the physicochemical properties suggest that the differences were caused by changes in the apparent nanofibril aspect ratio and surface accessibility.

Substrate oxidation occurs near the T1, and electrons are transferred approximately 13 A ̊ through the protein via the Cys-His pathway to the T2/T3 trinuclear copper cluster (TNC), where dioxygen reduction occurs. This review outlines the electron transfer (ET) process in laccases, and the mecha- nism of O2 reduction as elucidated through spectroscopic, kinetic, and computational data. Marcus theory is used to describe the relevant factors which impact ET rates including the driving force, reorganization energy, and electronic coupling matrix element.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Plant cell walls as mechanical signaling hubs for morphogenesis;,citation_abstract=The instructive role of mechanical cues during morphogenesis is increasingly being recognized in all kingdoms. Patterns of mechanical stress depend on shape, growth and external factors. In plants, the cell wall integrates these three parameters to function as a hub for mechanical feedback. Plant cells are interconnected by cell walls that provide structural integrity and yet are flexible enough to act as both targets and transducers of mechanical cues. Such cues may act locally at the subcellular level or across entire tissues, requiring tight control of both cell-wall composition and cell–cell adhesion. Here we focus on how changes in cell-wall chemistry and mechanics act in communicating diverse cues to direct growth asymmetries required for plant morphogenesis. We explore the role of cellulose microfibrils, microtubule arrays and pectin methylesterification in the transduction of mechanical cues during morphogenesis. Plant hormones can affect the mechanochemical composition of the cell wall and, in turn, the cell wall can modulate hormone signaling pathways, as well as the tissue-level distribution of these hormones. This also leads us to revisit the position of biochemical growth factors, such as plant hormones, acting both upstream and downstream of mechanical signaling. Finally, while the structure of the cell wall is being elucidated with increasing precision, existing data clearly show that the integration of genetic, biochemical and theoretical studies will be essential for a better understanding of the role of the cell wall as a hub for the mechanical control of plant morphogenesis.;,citation_author=Kristoffer Jonsson;,citation_author=Olivier Hamant;,citation_author=Rishikesh P.

Although defense responses to leaf-chewing insects have been well studied, little is known about stem-specific responses, particularly in the pith, to stem-boring herbivores. To understand the stem-specific defense, we first conducted a comparative transcriptomic analysis of the wild tobacco Nicotiana attenuata before and after attack by the leaf-chewing herbivore Manduca sexta and the stem borer Trichobaris mucorea. When the stem-boring herbivore attacked, lignin-associated genes were upregulated specifically in the inner parenchymal cells of the stem, the pith; lignin also accumulated highly in the attacked pith. Silencing the lignin biosynthetic gene cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase enhanced the performance of the stem-boring herbivore but had no effect on the growth of the leaf-chewing herbivore. Two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance results revealed that lignified pith contains feruloyltyramine as an unusual lignin component in the cell wall, as a response against stem-boring herbivore attack. Pith-specific lignification induced by the stem-boring herbivore was modulated by both jasmonate and ethylene signaling.

In the present work, the ultrastructural distribution of lignin in the cell walls of normal and tension wood fibres from poplar (Populus deltoides Bartr. ex Marshall) was investigated by transmission electron microscopy using cryo-fixation-freeze-substitution in association with immunogold probes directed against typical structural motifs of lignin. The specificity of the immunological probes for condensed and non-condensed guaiacyl and syringyl interunit linkages of lignin, and their high sensitivity, allowed detection of lignin epitopes of definite chemical structures in the G-layer of tension wood fibres. Semi-quantitative distribution of the corresponding epitopes revealed the abundance of syringyl units in the G-layer. Predominating non-condensed lignin sub-structures appeared to be embedded in the crystalline cellulose matrix prevailing in the G-layer. The endwise mode of polymerization that is known to lead to these types of lignin structures appears consistent with such an organized cellulose environment. Immunochemical labelling provides the first visualization in planta of lignin structures within the G-layer of tension wood. The patterns of distribution of syringyl epitopes indicate that syringyl lignin is deposited more intensely in the later phase of fibre secondary wall assembly.

At this final stage, the double mutant had retained a very limited ability to biosynthesize monolignols as evidenced by cleavage and release of ca. 4% of the monolignol-derived moieties relative to the lignin of the WT line. In addition, while small amounts of cleavable p-hydroxycinnamaldehyde-derived moieties were released, the overall frequency of (monomer cleavable) 8-O-4\prime inter-unit linkages closely approximated that of WT for the equivalent level of lignin deposition, in spite of the differences in monomer composition. Additionally, 8–5\prime linked inter-unit structures were clearly evident, albeit as fully aromatized phenylcoumaran-like substructures. The data are interpreted as a small amount of p-hydroxycinnamaldehydes being utilized in highly restricted attempts to preserve native lignin configuration, i.e. through very limited monomer degeneracy during template polymerization which would otherwise afford lignins proper in the cell wall from their precursor monolignols. The defects introduced (e.g. in the vascular integrity) provide important insight as to why p-hydroxycinnamaldehydes never evolved as lignin precursors in the 350,000 or so extant vascular plant species. It is yet unknown at present, however, as to what levels of lignin reduction can be attained in order to maintain the requisite properties for successful agronomic/forestry cultivation. Nor is it known to what extent, if any, such deleterious modulations potentially compromise plant defenses. Finally, prior to investigating lignin primary structure proper, it is essential to initially define the fundamental characteristics of the biopolymer(s) being formed, such as inter-unit frequency and lignin content, in order to design approaches to determine overall sequences of linkages.;,citation_author=Michaël Jourdes;,citation_author=Claudia L.

The clones exhibit 93 and 86% sequence identity at the nucleotide and deduced amino acid levels, respectively. Both clones contain two copper-binding domains characterized by histidine-rich regions, which are found ubiquitously in all polyphenol oxidases/tyrosinases, and a putative third histidine-rich, copper-binding region, which is common to all plant polyphenol oxidases. One of the Phytolacca cDNA deduced amino acid sequences contains the ubiquitous transit peptide for all proteins targeted to the internal lumen of thylakoid membranes of plastids and is considered to be 98 residues in length based on a proposed sequence cleavage site motif. This would produce a processed peptide of approximately 54 kD. In addition to common features of transit peptides, it was found that an additional conserved region for polyphenol oxidases was located between the hydroxy amino acid-rich region and the thylakoid transfer domain. Spatial and temporal expression was investigated by northern blot analysis of total RNA from various organs of Phytolacca plants.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Highly accurate protein structure prediction with AlphaFold;,citation_abstract=Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort1–4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the “protein folding problem”8—has been an important open research problem for more than 50&nbsp;years9. Despite recent progress10–14, existing methods fall far&nbsp;short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available.

The 2H-1-benzopyran-2-one core structure of coumarins is formed via the ortho-hydroxylation of cinnamates, trans/cis isomerization of the side chain, and lactonization. Ortho-hydroxylation is a key step in coumarin biosynthesis as a branch point from lignin biosynthesis; however, ortho-hydroxylation of cinnamates is not yet fully understood. In this study, scopoletin biosynthesis was explored using Arabidopsis thaliana, which accumulates scopoletin and its beta-glucopyranoside scopolin in its roots. T-DNA insertion mutants of caffeoyl CoA O-methyltransferase 1 (CCoAOMT1) showed significant reduction in scopoletin and scopolin levels in the roots, and recombinant CCoAOMT1 exhibited 3’-O-methyltransferase activity on caffeoyl CoA to feruloyl CoA. These results suggest that feruloyl CoA is a key precursor in scopoletin biosynthesis. Ortho-hydroxylases of cinnamates were explored in the oxygenase families in A. thaliana, and one of the candidate genes in the Fe(II)- and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase (2OGD) family was designated as F6’H1. T-DNA insertion mutants of F6’H1 showed severe reductions in scopoletin and scopolin levels in the roots. The pattern of F6’H1 expression is consistent with the patterns of scopoletin and scopolin accumulation. The recombinant F6’H1 protein exhibited ortho-hydroxylase activity for feruloyl CoA (K(m) = 36.0 +/- 4.27 microM; k(cat) = 11.0 +/- 0.45 sec(-1)) to form 6’-hydroxyferuloyl CoA, but did not hydroxylate ferulic acid. These results indicate that Fe(II)- and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase is the pivotal enzyme in the ortho-hydroxylation of feruloyl CoA in scopoletin biosynthesis.;,citation_author=Kosuke Kai;,citation_author=Masaharu Mizutani;,citation_author=Naohiro Kawamura;,citation_author=Ryotaro Yamamoto;,citation_author=Michiko Tamai;,citation_author=Hikaru Yamaguchi;,citation_author=Kanzo Sakata;,citation_author=Bun Ichi Shimizu;,citation_publication_date=2008;,citation_cover_date=2008;,citation_year=2008;,citation_issue=6;,citation_doi=10.1111/j.1365-313X.2008.03568.x;,citation_isbn=1365-313X (Electronic){\textbackslash}n0960-7412 (Linking);,citation_issn=09607412;,citation_pmid=18547395;,citation_volume=55;,citation_journal_title=Plant J.;">

It is known that the Spätzle-processing enzyme is a key enzyme in the production of cleaved Spätzle from pro-Spätzle in the Drosophila Toll pathway. Here, we provide biochemical evidence that the Tenebrio molitor Spätzle-processing enzyme converts both the 79-kDa Tenebrio prophenoloxidase and Tenebrio clip-domain SPH1 zymogen to an active melanization complex. This complex, consisting of the 76-kDa Tenebrio phenoloxidase and an active form of Tenebrio clip-domain SPH1, efficiently produces melanin on the surface of bacteria, and this activity has a strong bactericidal effect. Interestingly, we found the phenoloxidase-induced melanization reaction to be tightly regulated by Tenebrio prophenoloxidase, which functions as a competitive inhibitor of melanization complex formation.

The objective of this study was to track the spatial distribution of monolignols during development as they move from symplasm to apoplasm. This was done by feeding [(3)H]phenylalanine ([(3)H]Phe) to dissected cambium/developing wood from lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var latifolia) seedlings, allowing uptake and metabolism, then rapidly freezing the cells and performing autoradiography to detect the locations of the monolignols responsible for lignification. Parallel experiments showed that radioactivity was incorporated into polymeric lignin and a methanol-soluble pool that was characterized by high-performance liquid chromatography. [(3)H]Phe was incorporated into expected lignin precursors, such as coniferyl alcohol and p-coumaryl alcohol, as well as pinoresinol. Coniferin, the glucoside of coniferyl alcohol, was detected by high-performance liquid chromatography but was not radioactively labeled. With light microscopy, radiolabeled phenylpropanoids were detected in the rays as well as the tracheids, with the two cell types showing differential sensitivity to inhibitors of protein translation and phenylpropanoid metabolism. Secondary cell walls of developing tracheids were heavily labeled when incubated with [(3)H]Phe. Inside the cell, cytoplasm was most strongly labeled followed by Golgi and low-vacuole label.

Tyrosinases perform two sequential enzymatic reactions: hydroxylation of monophenols and oxidation of diphenols to form quinones which polymerize spontaneously to melanin. Two other members of this family are catechol oxidases, which are prevalent mainly in plants and perform only the second oxidation step, and hemocyanins, which lack enzymatic activity and are oxygen carriers.

It is also a major barrier to the deconstruction of plant biomass for bioenergy production, but the spatiotemporal details of how lignin is deposited in actively lignifying tissues and the precise relationships between wall lignification in different cell types and developmental events, such as flowering, are incompletely understood. Here, the lignin-detecting fluorogenic dye, Basic Fuchsin, was adapted to enable comparative fluorescence-based imaging of lignin in the basal internodes of three Brachypodium distachyon ecotypes that display divergent flowering times. It was found that the extent and intensity of Basic Fuchsin fluorescence increase over time in the Bd21-3 ecotype, that Basic Fuchsin staining is more widespread and intense in 4-week-old Bd21-3 and Adi-10 basal internodes than in Bd1-1 internodes, and that Basic Fuchsin staining reveals subcellular patterns of lignin in vascular and interfascicular fibre cell walls. Basic Fuchsin fluorescence did not correlate with lignin quantification by acetyl bromide analysis, indicating that whole-plant and subcellular lignin analyses provide distinct information about the extent and patterns of lignification in B. distachyon. Finally, it was found that flowering time correlated with a transient increase in total lignin, but did not correlate strongly with the patterning of stem lignification, suggesting that additional developmental pathways might regulate secondary wall formation in grasses.

Its physiological function is unknown, but its localization makes it a suitable candidate for participation in photoinhibition repair by degradation of the photosystem II reaction center protein D1. We transformed Arabidopsis thaliana with an RNA interference construct and obtained plants with reduced levels of Deg1. These plants were smaller than wild-type plants, flowered earlier, were more sensitive to photoinhibition, and accumulated more of the D1 protein, probably in an inactive form. Two C-terminal degradation products of the D1 protein, of 16 and 5.2 kD, accumulated at lower levels compared with the wild type. Moreover, addition of recombinant Deg1 to inside-out thylakoid membranes isolated from the mutant could induce the formation of the 5.2-kD D1 C-terminal fragment, whereas the unrelated proteases trypsin and thermolysin could not. Immunoblot analysis revealed that mutants containing less Deg1 also contain less FtsH protease, and FtsH mutants contain less Deg1. These results suggest that Deg1 cooperates with the stroma-exposed proteases FtsH and Deg2 in degrading D1 protein during repair from photoinhibition by cleaving lumen-exposed regions of the protein.

N- and C-terminal putative signal peptides were present, suggesting a vacuolar location of the peroxidase. Immunoblotting and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction showed that the Prx7 protein and mRNA accumulated abundantly in barley coleoptiles and in leaf epidermis inoculated with powdery mildew fungus (Blumeria graminis).

The peroxidase activity due to Prx7 accumulated in barley leaves 24 h after inoculation with powdery mildew spores or by wounding of epidermal cells. Prx7 accumulated predominantly in the epidermis, apparently in the vacuole, and appeared to be the only pathogen-induced vacuolar peroxidase expressed in barley tissues.

We find that TTLs are essential for maintaining cellulose synthesis under salinity stress, establishing a stress-resilient cortical microtubule array, and stabilizing CSCs at the plasma membrane. To fulfill these functions, TTLs interact with Cellulose Synthase1 (CESA1) and engage with cortical microtubules to promote their polymerization.

Their toxicity such as strong endocrine disruption demands effective remediation methods. Laccases from Trametes versicolor and Pleurotus ostreatus were tested to degrade hydroxy PCBs. Optimum pHs for both enzymes were around 4.0. Laccase from T. versicolor degrades hydroxy PCBs more rapidly than that from P. ostreatus. The enzymatic activities remained little changes in up to 10% organic solvents, but decreased rapidly in more than 10% acetone, acetonitrile or DMSO. Degradation rate constants decreased with increase of chlorination and no degradation was observed with tetra-, penta- and hexa-chloro hydroxy PCBs in non-mediated reactions. However, the tetra- to hexa-chloro hydroxy PCBs were degraded by laccase from T. versicolor in the presence of the mediator 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxy radical. The other mediators, 4-ethyl-2-methoxyphenol, 2,2\prime-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline sulfonic acid) diammonium salt and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole and humic acid, also enhanced degradation of all the hydroxy PCBs except 4-hydroxy-2\prime,3,3\prime,4\prime,5,5\prime-hexachlorobiphenyl. The results showed that 3-hydroxy biphenyl was more resistant to laccase degradation than 2- or 4-hydroxy analogues.

LACCASEs, a family of cell wall-localized multicopper oxidases, are involved in lignin biosynthesis. We demonstrate here that LACCASE2 (LAC2) acts as a negative regulator of lignin deposition in root vascular tissues during water deficit. An Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) transfer DNA insertion mutant of LAC2 displayed a short primary root and high lignin deposition in root vascular tissues. However, restoration of LAC2 expression rescued these phenotypes. LAC2 expression was significantly down-regulated under water deficit and posttranscriptionally regulated by microRNA397b (miR397b) in roots under normal and water-deficit conditions. Down-regulation of miR397b activity increased LAC2 expression and root length, and decreased lignin content in root vasculature. Similarly, phosphate (Pi) deficiency inversely affected miR397b and LAC2 expression. Lignin deposition in the root elongation zone under Pi-limited conditions was dependent on LAC2 expression. Localized iron accumulation and callose deposition in the root elongation zone under Pi deficiency increased with LAC2-dependent lignification, suggesting a direct relationship between these processes.

The CAD-downregulated tobacco also has higher levels of hydroxycinnamaldehyde and hydroxybenzaldehyde (mainly syringaldehyde) incorporation, but the analogous two types of 8-O-4-coupled products are the dominant features. 8-8-Coupled units are also clearly evident. There is clear evidence for coupling of hydroxycinnamaldehydes to each other and then incorporation into the lignin, as well as for the incorporation of hydroxycinnamaldehyde monomers into the growing lignin polymer. Coniferaldehyde and sinapaldehyde (as well as vanillin and syringaldehyde) co-polymerize with the traditional monolignols into lignins and do so at enhanced levels when CAD-deficiency has an impact on the normal monolignol production. The implication is that, particularly in angiosperms, the aldehydes behave like the traditional monolignols and should probably be regarded as authentic lignin monomers in normal and CAD-deficient plants.;,citation_author=Hoon Kim;,citation_author=John Ralph;,citation_author=Fachuang Lu;,citation_author=Sally Ralph;,citation_author=Alain M Boudet;,citation_author=John J MacKay;,citation_author=Ronald R Sederoff;,citation_author=Takashi Ito;,citation_author=Shingo Kawai;,citation_author=Hideo Ohashi;,citation_author=Takayoshi Higuchi;,citation_publication_date=2003;,citation_cover_date=2003;,citation_year=2003;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12929422;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1039/b209686b;,citation_isbn=1477-0520;,citation_issn=1477-0520;,citation_pmid=12929422;,citation_volume=1;,citation_journal_title=Org.

Here, we examined the physiological role of a salt-responsive NTL, NTL8, by molecular genetic and transgenic approaches. NTL8 is expressed as a membrane-associated, dormant form and subsequently processed into a transcriptionally active, nuclear form. Transgenic plants overproducing an active NTL8 form exhibited delayed flowering as well as reduced growth with small curled leaves. Accordingly, expression of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) and its downstream genes was significantly reduced in the transgenic plants. Furthermore, FT was significantly repressed by high salt.

Recently, transcription factor MYB46 has been identified as a master regulator of secondary wall biosynthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana. To gain better understanding of this MYB46-mediated transcriptional regulation, we analyzed the promoter region of a direct target gene, AtC3H14, of MYB46 and identified a cis-acting regulatory motif that is recognized by MYB46.

We used electrophoretic mobility shift assay, transient transcriptional activation assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis to show that the M46RE was necessary and sufficient for MYB46-responsive transcription.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Chemically Induced Conditional Rescue of the Reduced Epidermal Fluorescence8 Mutant of Arabidopsis Reveals Rapid Restoration of Growth and Selective Turnover of Secondary Metabolite Pools;,citation_abstract=The phenylpropanoid pathway is responsible for the biosynthesis of diverse and important secondary metabolites including lignin and flavonoids. The reduced epidermal fluorescence8 (ref8) mutant of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), which is defective in a lignin biosynthetic enzyme p-coumaroyl shikimate 3’-hydroxylase (C3’H), exhibits severe dwarfism and sterility. To better understand the impact of perturbation of phenylpropanoid metabolism on plant growth, we generated a chemically inducible C3’H expression construct and transformed it into the ref8 mutant. Application of dexamethasone to these plants greatly alleviates the dwarfism and sterility and substantially reverses the biochemical phenotypes of ref8 plants, including the reduction of lignin content and hyperaccumulation of flavonoids and p-coumarate esters. Induction of C3’H expression at different developmental stages has distinct impacts on plant growth. Although early induction effectively restored the elongation of primary inflorescence stem, application to 7-week-old plants enabled them to produce new rosette inflorescence stems. Examination of hypocotyls of these plants revealed normal vasculature in the newly formed secondary xylem, presumably restoring water transport in the mutant. The ref8 mutant accumulates higher levels of salicylic acid than the wild type, but depletion of this compound in ref8 did not relieve the mutant’s growth defects, suggesting that the hyperaccumulation of salicylic acid is unlikely to be responsible for dwarfism in this mutant.;,citation_author=J.

A subset of plants, including many related to Arabidopsis thaliana, synthesizes glucosinolates, nitrogen- and sulfur-containing secondary metabolites that serve as components of a plant defense system that deters herbivores and pathogens. Here, we report that the Arabidopsis thaliana reduced epidermal fluorescence5 (ref5-1) mutant, identified in a screen for plants with defects in soluble phenylpropanoid accumulation, has a missense mutation in CYP83B1 and displays defects in glucosinolate biosynthesis and in phenylpropanoid accumulation. CYP79B2 and CYP79B3 are responsible for the production of the CYP83B1 substrate indole-3-acetaldoxime (IAOx), and we found that the phenylpropanoid content of cyp79b2 cyp79b3 and ref5-1 cyp79b2 cyp79b3 plants is increased compared with the wild type. These data suggest that levels of IAOx or a subsequent metabolite negatively influence phenylpropanoid accumulation in ref5 and more importantly that this crosstalk is relevant in the wild type.

In this paper, we derive the relationship between the physical oceanographic processes that transport these larvae and the strength of species interactions in the benthic habitat. We review a model of hierarchical competition for space between two species with planktonic larvae and develop a model for predator-prey dynamics in which prey are space-limited. Lotka-Volterra approximations to these models are developed. The approximations provide per capita interaction strength (the effect of an individual of one species on the per capita growth rate of another) and population interaction strength (the effect of a population of one species on the per capita growth rate of another) as functions of parameters in the original model. Per capita and population interaction strengths of dominant competitors on subordinates decrease in magnitude as offshore advection of larvae increases. The per capita effect of prey on predators also decreases as offshore advection increases, but population interaction strength is independent of offshore advection rate. Conversely, the per capita effect of predators on prey is independent of offshore larval advection rate, but the population effect decreases as offshore advection increases. We also develop submodels that simulate experimental removals of competitors and predators. Measurements of interaction strength derived from these simulations decrease as offshore advection of larvae increases.

In particular, differences in ultrastructure and chemistry within the same cell type between earlywood (EW) and latewood (LW) are poorly understood. This study investigated the ultrastructure and chemistry of (vasicentric) tracheids, vessels, (libriform) fibers and axial/ray parenchyma cells of English oak xylem (Quercus robur L.) using light-, fluorescence- and transmission electron microscopy combined with histo/cytochemistry and immunohisto/ cytochemistry. EW tracheids showed several differences from LW tracheids including thinner cell walls, wider middle lamella cell corner (MLcc) regions and lesser amounts of mannan epitopes. Fibers showed thicker cell walls and higher amounts of mannan epitopes than tracheids. EW vessels were rich in guaiacyl (G) lignin with a characteristic non-layered cell wall organization (absence of S1–3 layers), whereas LW vessels were rich in syringyl (S) lignin with a three layered cell wall structure (S1–3 layers). Formation of a highly lignified and wide protective layer (PL) inside axial/ray parenchyma cells was detected only in EW. Distribution of mannan epitopes varied greatly between cell types and between EW and LW, whereas distribution of xylan epitopes was almost identical in all cell types within a growth ring.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Distribution of lignin, pectins and hemicelluloses in tension wood fibers of European ash (Fraxinus excelsior);,citation_abstract=ABSTRACT Although there is considerable information on the chemistry of gelatinous (G) layers in tension wood (TW) fibers consisting of S1 + S2 + G cell wall structure (poplar), little is known on the chemistry of G-layers in TW fibers organized with S1+ G structure. This study investigated the distribution of lignin and non-cellulosic polysaccharides in ash TW fibers (S1+ G) using histochemistry and immunolocalization methods. TW fibers studied were fully developed (mature fibers) and obtained from two (TW-1, TW-2) mature European ash trees (Fraxinus excelsior L.). Based on differences in microfibril angle (MFA) and TW trees used, TW fibers were mainly classified into three types; 1) Type-1 fibers with MFA almost parallel to the fiber axis that were found in TW-1, 2) Type-2 fibers with 12^\circ MFA that were abundant at the end of growth rings of TW-1 and 3) Type-3 fibers with 10^\circ MFA that were found in TW-2. The S3 layer was absent in all TW fibers. In this study, the secondary cell wall structure of Type-1 and Type-2/Type-3 fibers were defined as G and GL (gelatinous-like) layers, respectively. Lignin with syringyl (S) units was detected in G/GL-layers, in which intensity and patterns of lignin staining likely related to the difference in MFA between G- and GL-layers. With hemicelluloses, heteroxylan and heteromannan epitopes were detected in G/GL-layers but these were much less abundant than those in S2 layers of normal wood (NW) fibers. Like lignin, distribution patterns of heteromannan epitopes in G/GL-layers likely related to differences in MFA between fiber types. Sparse xyloglucan epitopes were also detected in G/GL-layers. Homogalacturonan epitopes were absent in G/GL-layers. All fiber types showed abundant a-1, 5-arabinan epitopes in G/GL-layers.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Glucosinolate and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis are linked by proteasome-dependent degradation of PAL;,citation_abstract=Plants produce several hundreds of thousands of secondary metabolites that are important for adaptation to various environmental conditions. Although different groups of secondary metabolites are synthesized through unique biosynthetic pathways, plants must orchestrate their production simultaneously. Phenylpropanoids and glucosinolates are two classes of secondary metabolites that are synthesized through apparently independent biosynthetic pathways. Genetic evidence has revealed that the accumulation of glucosinolate intermediates limits phenylpropanoid production in a Mediator Subunit 5 (MED5)-dependent manner. To elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying this process, we analyzed the transcriptomes of a suite of Arabidopsis thaliana glucosinolate-deficient mutants using RNAseq and identified misregulated genes that are rescued by the disruption of MED5. The expression of a group of Kelch Domain F-Box genes (KFBs) that function in PAL degradation is affected in glucosinolate biosynthesis mutants and the disruption of these KFBs restores phenylpropanoid deficiency in the mutants. Our study suggests that glucosinolate/phenylpropanoid metabolic crosstalk involves the transcriptional regulation of KFB genes that initiate the degradation of the enzyme phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, which catalyzes the first step of the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway. Nevertheless, KFB mutant plants remain partially sensitive to glucosinolate pathway mutations, suggesting that other mechanisms that link the two pathways also exist.;,citation_author=Jeong Im Kim;,citation_author=Xuebin Zhang;,citation_author=Pete E.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A temperature-sensitive FERONIA mutant allele that alters root hair growth;,citation_abstract=In plants, root hairs undergo a highly polarized form of cell expansion called tip-growth, in which cell wall deposition is restricted to the root hair apex. In order to identify essential cellular components that might have been missed in earlier genetic screens, we identified conditional temperature-sensitive (ts) root hair mutants by ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenesis in Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, we describe one of these mutants, feronia-temperature sensitive (fer-ts). Mutant fer-ts seedlings were unaffected at normal temperatures (20^\circC), but failed to form root hairs at elevated temperatures (30^\circC). Map based-cloning and whole-genome sequencing revealed that fer-ts resulted from a G41S substitution in the extracellular domain of FERONIA (FER). A functional fluorescent fusion of FER containing the fer-ts mutation localized to plasma membranes, but was subject to enhanced protein turnover at elevated temperatures. While tip-growth was rapidly inhibited by addition of rapid alkalinization factor 1 (RALF1) peptides in both wild-type and fer-ts mutants at normal temperatures, root elongation of fer-ts seedlings was resistant to added RALF1 peptide at elevated temperatures. Additionally, at elevated temperatures fer-ts seedlings displayed altered reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation upon auxin treatment and phenocopied constitutive fer mutant responses to a variety of plant hormone treatments. Molecular modeling and sequence comparison with other Catharanthus roseus receptor-like kinase 1L (CrRLK1L) receptor family members revealed that the mutated glycine in fer-ts is highly conserved, but is not located within the recently characterized RALF23 and LORELI-LIKE-GLYCOPROTEIN 2 binding domains, perhaps suggesting that fer-ts phenotypes may not be directly due to loss of binding to RALF1 peptides.;,citation_author=Daewon Kim;,citation_author=Jiyuan Yang;,citation_author=Fangwei Gu;,citation_author=Sungjin Park;,citation_author=Jonathon Combs;,citation_author=Alexander Adams;,citation_author=Heather B Mayes;,citation_author=Su Jeong Jeon;,citation_author=Jeong Dong Bahk;,citation_author=Erik Nielsen;,citation_publication_date=2021-02;,citation_cover_date=2021-02;,citation_year=2021;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1093/plphys/kiaa051;,citation_issn=0032-0889;,citation_volume=185;,citation_journal_title=Plant Physiol.;">

The existence of both syringyl and guaiacyl units is effective for producing higher amounts of \beta-O-4 and 4-O-5 structures, but it lowers the total amount of cinnamyl alcohol and aldehyde end groups. The relative frequency of the \beta-\beta structure increased, whereas that of \beta-5 and 5-5 structures decreased with increasing syringyl units.;,citation_author=Takao Kishimoto;,citation_author=Wakako Chiba;,citation_author=Kaori Saito;,citation_author=Kazuhiko Fukushima;,citation_author=Yasumitsu Uraki;,citation_author=Makoto Ubukata;,citation_publication_date=2010-01;,citation_cover_date=2010-01;,citation_year=2010;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1021/jf9035172;,citation_issn=0021-8561;,citation_volume=58;,citation_journal_title=J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Tyloses and Phenolic Deposits in Xylem Vessels Impede Water Transport in Low-Lignin Transgenic Poplars: A Study by Cryo-Fluorescence Microscopy;,citation_abstract=Of 14 transgenic poplar genotypes (Populus tremula  Populus alba) with antisense 4-coumarate:coenzyme A ligase that were grown in the field for 2 years, five that had substantial lignin reductions also had greatly reduced xylem-specific conductivity compared with that of control trees and those transgenic events with small reductions in lignin. For the two events with the lowest xylem lignin contents (greater than 40% reduction), we used light microscopy methods and acid fuchsin dye ascent studies to clarify what caused their reduced transport efficiency. A novel protocol involving dye stabilization and cryo-fluorescence microscopy enabled us to visualize the dye at the cellular level and to identify water-conducting pathways in the xylem. Cryo-fixed branch segments were planed in the frozen state on a sliding cryo-microtome and observed with an epifluorescence microscope equipped with a cryo-stage. We could then distinguish clearly between phenolic-occluded vessels, conductive (stain-filled) vessels, and nonconductive (water- or gas-filled) vessels. Low-lignin trees contained areas of nonconductive, brown xylem with patches of collapsed cells and patches of noncollapsed cells filled with phenolics. In contrast, phenolics and nonconductive vessels were rarely observed in normal colored wood of the low-lignin events. The results of cryo-fluorescence light microscopy were supported by observations with a confocal microscope after freeze drying of cryo-planed samples. Moreover, after extraction of the phenolics, confocal microscopy revealed that many of the vessels in the nonconductive xylem were blocked with tyloses. We conclude that reduced transport efficiency of the transgenic low-lignin xylem was largely caused by blockages from tyloses and phenolic deposits within vessels rather than by xylem collapse.;,citation_author=Peter Kitin;,citation_author=Steven L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Root proteases: Reinforced links between nitrogen uptake and mobilization and drought tolerance;,citation_abstract=Integral subcellular and cellular functions ranging from gene expression, protein targeting and nutrient supply to cell differentiation and cell death require proteases. Plants have unique organelles such as chloroplasts composed of unique proteins that carry out the unique process of photosynthesis. Hence, along with proteases common across kingdoms, plants contain unique proteases. Improved knowledge on proteases can lead to a better understanding of plant development, differentiation and death. Because of their importance in multiple processes, plant proteases are actively studied. However, root proteases specifically are not as well studied. The associated rhizosphere, organic matter and/or inorganic matter make roots a difficult system. Yet recent research conclusively demonstrated the occurrence of endocytosis of proteins, peptides and even microbes by root cells, which, hitherto known for specialized pathogenesis or symbiosis, was unsuspected for nutrient uptake. These results reinforced the importance of root proteases in endocytosis or root exudate-mediated nutrient uptake. Rhizoplane, rhizosphere or in planta protease action on proteins, peptides and microbes generates sources of nitrogen, especially during abiotic stresses such as drought. This article highlights the recent research on root proteases for nitrogen uptake and the connection of the two to drought-tolerance mechanisms. Drought-induced proteases in rice roots, as known from rice expression databases, are discussed for future research on certain M50, Deg, FtsH, AMSH and deubiquitination proteases. The recent emphasis on linking drought and plant hydraulics to nutrient metabolism is illustrated and connected to the value of a systematic study of root proteases in crop improvement.;,citation_author=Ajay Kohli;,citation_author=Joan Onate Narciso;,citation_author=Berta Miro;,citation_author=Manish Raorane;,citation_publication_date=2012;,citation_cover_date=2012;,citation_year=2012;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1111/j.1399-3054.2012.01573.x;,citation_isbn=0031-9317;,citation_issn=00319317;,citation_pmid=22242864;,citation_volume=145;,citation_journal_title=Physiol.

X-ray structure analysis revealed a homotrimeric architecture for this enzyme, which resembles nitrite reductase (NIR).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Regulation of Plasmodesmatal Permeability and Stomatal Patterning by the Glycosyltransferase-Like Protein KOBITO1;,citation_abstract=The differentiation of stomata provides a convenient model for studying pattern formation in plant tissues. Stomata formation is induced by a set of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors and inhibited by a signal transduction pathway initiated by TOO MANY MOUTHS (TMM) and ERECTA family (ERf) receptors. The formation of a proper stomata pattern is also dependent upon the restriction of symplastic movement of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors into neighboring cells, especially in the backgrounds where the function of the TMM/ERf signaling pathway is compromised. Here, we describe a novel mutant of KOBITO1 in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). The kob1-3 mutation leads to the formation of stomata clusters in the erl1 erl2 background but not in the wild type. Cell-to-cell mobility assays demonstrated an increase in intercellular protein trafficking in kob1-3, including increased diffusion of SPEECHLESS, suggesting that the formation of stomata clusters is due to an escape of cell fate-specifying factors from stomatal lineage cells. While plasmodesmatal permeability is increased in kob1-3, we did not detect drastic changes in callose accumulation at the neck regions of the plasmodesmata. Previously, KOBITO1 has been proposed to function in cellulose biosynthesis. Our data demonstrate that disruption of cellulose biosynthesis in the erl1 erl2 background does not lead to the formation of stomata clusters, indicating that cellulose biosynthesis is not a major determining factor for regulating plasmodesmatal permeability. Analysis of KOBITO1 structure suggests that it is a glycosyltransferase-like protein. KOBITO1 might be involved in a carbohydrate metabolic pathway that is essential for both cellulose biosynthesis and the regulation of plasmodesmatal permeability.;,citation_author=Danyu Kong;,citation_author=Rucha Karve;,citation_author=Alaina Willet;,citation_author=Ming-Kun Chen;,citation_author=Jennifer Oden;,citation_author=Elena D.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Effects of high NH+4 on K+ uptake, culm mechanical strength and grain filling in wheat;,citation_abstract=It is well established that a high external NH4+ concentration depresses many processes in plant development, but the underlying mechanisms are still not well understood. To determine whether the negative effects of high levels of NH4+ are related to competitive cation uptake, wheat was grown in a field with moderate (18 g N m-2) and high (30 g N m-2) supplies of NH4+ in the presence or absence of additional K+ (6 g K2O m-2) to examine culm mechanical strength, the main components of the vascular bundle, nitrogen (N) remobilization and the grain-filling rate. The results indicated that an excessive supply of NH4+ significantly decreased culm mechanical strength, the cellulose and lignin contents of vascular bundles, the N remobilization efficiency (NRE) and the grain-filling rate compared with a moderate level of NH4+. The additional provision of K+ considerably alleviated these negative effects of high NH4+, resulting in a 19.41%-26.95% increase in culm mechanical strength during grain filling and a 34.59% increase in the NRE. An assay using the scanning ion-selective electrode technique (SIET) showed that the net rate of transmembrane K+ influx decreased by 84.62%, and measurements using flame photometry demonstrated that the K+ content decreased by 36.13% in wheat plants subjected to high NH4+.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Geometry of the Gene Expression Space of Individual Cells;,citation_abstract=There is a revolution in the ability to analyze gene expression of single cells in a tissue. To understand this data we must comprehend how cells are distributed in a high-dimensional gene expression space. One open question is whether cell types form discrete clusters or whether gene expression forms a continuum of states. If such a continuum exists, what is its geometry? Recent theory on evolutionary trade-offs suggests that cells that need to perform multiple tasks are arranged in a polygon or polyhedron (line, triangle, tetrahedron and so on, generally called polytopes) in gene expression space, whose vertices are the expression profiles optimal for each task. Here, we analyze single-cell data from human and mouse tissues profiled using a variety of single-cell technologies. We fit the data to shapes with different numbers of vertices, compute their statistical significance, and infer their tasks. We find cases in which single cells fill out a continuum of expression states within a polyhedron. This occurs in intestinal progenitor cells, which fill out a tetrahedron in gene expression space. The four vertices of this tetrahedron are each enriched with genes for a specific task related to stemness and early differentiation. A polyhedral continuum of states is also found in spleen dendritic cells, known to perform multiple immune tasks: cells fill out a tetrahedron whose vertices correspond to key tasks related to maturation, pathogen sensing and communication with lymphocytes. A mixture of continuum-like distributions and discrete clusters is found in other cell types, including bone marrow and differentiated intestinal crypt cells. This approach can be used to understand the geometry and biological tasks of a wide range of single-cell datasets. The present results suggest that the concept of cell type may be expanded. In addition to discreet clusters in gene-expression space, we suggest a new possibility: a continuum of states within a polyhedron, in which the vertices represent specialists at key tasks.;,citation_author=Yael Korem;,citation_author=Pablo Szekely;,citation_author=Yuval Hart;,citation_author=Hila Sheftel;,citation_author=Jean Hausser;,citation_author=Avi Mayo;,citation_author=Michael E.

This difference probably reflects differences in the in vivo conditions as no chelator was present during the isolation procedure.

Suberin plays a critical role in plant water relations and in protecting plants from biotic and abiotic stresses. Here we describe a transcription factor, AtMYB41 (At4g28110), that can activate the steps necessary for aliphatic suberin synthesis and deposition of cell wall-associated suberin-like lamellae in both Arabidopsis thaliana and Nicotiana benthamiana. Overexpression of AtMYB41 increased the abundance of suberin biosynthetic gene transcripts by orders of magnitude and resulted in the accumulation of up to 22 times more suberin-type than cutin-type aliphatic monomers in leaves. Overexpression of AtMYB41 also resulted in elevated amounts of monolignols in leaves and an increase in the accumulation of phenylpropanoid and lignin biosynthetic gene transcripts. Surprisingly, ultrastructural data indicated that overexpression led to the formation of suberin-like lamellae in both epidermal and mesophyll cells of leaves. We further implicate AtMYB41 in the production of aliphatic suberin under abiotic stress conditions.

Wounding and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) induce expression of ppo genes and markedly increase the level of the enzyme. We report that pretreatment with MeJA also markedly increased the ability of isolated tomato chloroplasts to import and process PPO precursors (pPPO). Pea (Pisum sativum L.) chloroplasts showed no such response. Wounding or ethylene alone was ineffective but ethylene was synergistic with MeJA. Treatment with MeJA conferred a strong binding of pPPO, or its processing intermediate, to thylakoids and subsequent translocation into the lumen and processing to the mature protein. The effect on PPO import and translocation was evident after 8-16 h exposure to MeJA. Membrane-bound pPPO was cross-linked to a proteinaceous component of the thylakoid translocation apparatus, apparently induced by MeJA. The import and processing of other nuclear-encoded thylakoid proteins were not affected by MeJA in tomato. A 90-kDa protein that co-fractionated with thylakoids was induced along with the increase in competence for PPO import, and was identified as the proteinase-inhibitor multicystatin. It is concluded that the 90-kDa protein observed is part of the MeJA-induced defense response of tomato, not a component of the thylakoid translocation apparatus.;,citation_author=Shai Koussevitzky;,citation_author=Emma Ne’eman;,citation_author=Eitan Harel;,citation_publication_date=2004;,citation_cover_date=2004;,citation_year=2004;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1007/s00425-004-1240-7;,citation_isbn=1858453410;,citation_issn=00320935;,citation_volume=219;,citation_journal_title=Planta;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Polyphenol oxidase can cross thylakoids by both the Tat and the Sec-dependent pathways: A putative role for two stromal processing sites;,citation_abstract=Polyphenol oxidase (PPO; EC 1.10.3.2 or EC 1.14.18.1), a thylakoid-lumen protein encoded by a nuclear gene, plays a role in the defense of plants against both herbivores and pathogens. Although previously reported to be a Tat (twin-arginine-dependent translocation) protein, the import of PPO by isolated chloroplasts was inhibited by azide, a diagnostic inhibitor of the Sec-dependent pathway. Import of PPO inhibited thylakoid translocation of a Tat protein and did not affect translocation of Sec-dependent proteins. In contrast, a pre-accumulated iPPO competed with Sec-dependent but not with Tat proteins. A previously reported second processing step in the stroma removes a twin-Arg that is part of a ’Sec-avoidance’ motif in the thylakoid targeting domain of PPO. When the second processing site was mutated, the import of the resulting precursor showed Sec-dependent characteristics. The PPO transit peptide could drive thylakoid translocation of a Tat protein in the dark. Azide inhibited the secretion of a PPO intermediate that lacks a twin-Arg to the periplasm of Escherichia coli, but had no effect on the export of the intermediate containing the twin-Arg. PPO is synthesized in plants in response to wound and pathogen-related signals and it is possible that when the Tat pathway is unable to translocate adequate amounts of newly synthesized PPO, translocation is diverted to the Sec-dependent pathway by processing the intermediate at the second site and removing the twin-Arg.;,citation_author=Shai Koussevitzky;,citation_author=Emma Ne’eman;,citation_author=Smadar Peleg;,citation_author=Eitan Harel;,citation_publication_date=2008;,citation_cover_date=2008;,citation_year=2008;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1111/j.1399-3054.2008.01074.x;,citation_issn=00319317;,citation_volume=133;,citation_journal_title=Physiol.

Map-based cloning revealed that tsd1 is a novel strong allele of the KOR1 gene, encoding a membrane-bound endo-1,4-\beta-d-glucanase involved in cellulose synthesis. To study developmental changes accompanying the aberrant growth of the tsd1 mutant, patterning in the meristems and the hormonal status were analysed by marker genes. Expression of key regulators of meristem maintenance, the CLV3 and STM genes, indicated the presence of numerous meristems in the tsd1 shoot callus. Expression of the LFY::GUS marker supported the ability of the tsd1 callus to form organ primordia, which however failed to develop further. An epidermal marker showed that the L1 layer was maintained only in distinct areas of the tsd1 callus, which could be a reason of disorganized shoot growth. In the tsd1 root meristem, quiescent center activity was lost early after germination, which caused differentiation of the root meristem. The spatial expression of genes reporting the auxin and cytokinin status was altered in the tsd1 mutant. Modifying the endogenous levels of these hormones partially rescued shoot and root development of the tsd1 mutant. Together, the work shows that TSD1/KOR1 is required for maintaining a correct meristematic pattern and organ growth as well as for a normal hormonal response.;,citation_author=Eva Krupková;,citation_author=Thomas Schmülling;,citation_publication_date=2009-12;,citation_cover_date=2009-12;,citation_year=2009;,citation_issue=6;,citation_doi=10.1007/s11103-009-9546-2;,citation_issn=1573-5028;,citation_volume=71;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Plant Mol.

Total numbers (from 1 to 17) and types of mco genes differ between analyzed species with no easy to recognize connection of gene distribution to fungal life styles. Types of mco genes might be present in one and absent in another fungus. Distinct types of genes have been multiplied at speciation in different organisms.

Biochemically best described are laccases sensu stricto due to their proposed roles in degradation of wood, straw and plant litter and due to the large interest in these enzymes in biotechnology. However, biological functions of laccases and other MCOs are generally little addressed. Functions in substrate degradation, symbiontic and pathogenic intercations, development, pigmentation and copper homeostasis have been put forward. Evidences for biological functions are in most instances rather circumstantial by correlations of expression.

Highly active, additional proteinases (75, 90, and 100 kD) appeared in the oldest tubers. Over 90% of the total proteolytic activity in aged tubers was sensitive to trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido (4-guanidino) butane or leupeptin, whereas pepstatin was the most effective inhibitor of proteinases in young tubers. Proteinases in aged tubers were also inhibited by crude extracts or purified PMC from young tubers, suggesting that the loss of PMC was responsible for the age-induced increase in proteinase activity. Nonenzymatic oxidation, glycation, and deamidation of proteins were enhanced by aging. Aged tubers developed “daughter” tubers that contained 3-fold more protein than “mother” tubers, with a polypeptide profile consistent with that of young tubers. Although PMC and patatin were absent from the older mother tubers, both proteins were expressed in the daughter tubers, indicating that aging did not compromise the efficacy of genes encoding PMC and patatin. Unlike the mother tubers, proteinase activity in daughter tubers was undetectable. Our results indicate that tuber aging nonenzymatically modifies proteins, which enhances their susceptibility to breakdown; we also identify a role for PMC in regulating protein turnover in potato tubers.;,citation_author=G.

Results demonstrated differential expression of proteins and metabolites upon Foc inoculations in the resistant plants compared with the susceptible ones. Additionally, expression analysis of candidate genes supported the proteomic and metabolic variations in the chickpea roots upon Foc inoculation. In particular, we found that the resistant plants revealed significant increase in the carbon and nitrogen metabolism; generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), lignification and phytoalexins. The levels of some of the pathogenesis-related proteins were significantly higher upon Foc inoculation in the resistant plant. Interestingly, results also exhibited the crucial role of altered Yang cycle, which contributed in different methylation reactions and unfolded protein response in the chickpea roots against Foc.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=An atlas of Arabidopsis protein S-acylation reveals its widespread role in plant cell organization and function;,citation_abstract=S-acylation is the addition of a fatty acid to a cysteine residue of a protein. While this modification may profoundly alter protein behaviour, its effects on the function of plant proteins remains poorly characterized, largely as a result of the lack of basic information regarding which proteins are S-acylated and where in the proteins the modification occurs. To address this gap in our knowledge, we used an optimized acyl-resin-assisted capture assay to perform a comprehensive analysis of plant protein S-acylation from six separate tissues. In our high- and medium-confidence groups, we identified 1,849 cysteines modified by S-acylation, which were located in 1,640 unique peptides from 1,094 different proteins. This represents around 6% of the detectable Arabidopsis proteome and suggests an important role for S-acylation in many essential cellular functions including trafficking, signalling and metabolism. To illustrate the potential of this dataset, we focus on cellulose synthesis and confirm the S-acylation of a number of proteins known to be involved in cellulose synthesis and trafficking of the cellulose synthase complex. In the secondary cell walls, cellulose synthesis requires three different catalytic subunits (CESA4, CESA7 and CESA8) that all exhibit striking sequence similarity and are all predicted to possess a RING-type zinc finger at their amino terminus composed of eight cysteines. For CESA8, we find evidence for S-acylation of these cysteines that is incompatible with any role in coordinating metal ions. We show that while CESA7 may possess a RING-type domain, the same region of CESA8 appears to have evolved a very different structure.

Expression of PER36 occurred only in oi2 cells for a few days around the torpedo stage. A PER36-green fluorescent protein fusion was secreted into the outer cell wall in a polarized manner. per36 mutants were defective in mucilage extrusion after seed imbibition due to the failure of outer cell wall rupture, although the mutants exhibited normal monosaccharide composition of the mucilage. This abnormal phenotype of per36 was rescued by pectin solubilization, which promoted cell wall loosening. These results suggest that PER36 regulates the degradation of the outer cell wall.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Functional dissection of sugar signals affecting gene expression in Arabidopsis thaliana;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Sugars modulate expression of hundreds of genes in plants. Previous studies on sugar signaling, using intact plants or plant tissues, were hampered by tissue heterogeneity, uneven sugar transport and/or inter-conversions of the applied sugars. This, in turn, could obscure the identity of a specific sugar that acts as a signal affecting expression of given gene in a given tissue or cell-type.\n\nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To bypass those biases, we have developed a novel biological system, based on stem-cell-like Arabidopsis suspension culture. The cells were grown in a hormone-free medium and were sustained on xylose as the only carbon source. Using functional genomics we have identified 290 sugar responsive genes, responding rapidly (within 1 h) and specifically to low concentration (1 mM) of glucose, fructose and/or sucrose. For selected genes, the true nature of the signaling sugar molecules and sites of sugar perception were further clarified using non-metabolizable sugar analogues. Using both transgenic and wild-type A. thaliana seedlings, it was shown that the expression of selected sugar-responsive genes was not restricted to a specific tissue or cell type and responded to photoperiod-related changes in sugar availability. This suggested that sugar-responsiveness of genes identified in the cell culture system was not biased toward heterotrophic background and resembled that in whole plants.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Altogether, our research strategy, using a combination of cell culture and whole plants, has provided an unequivocal evidence for the identity of sugar-responsive genes and the identity of the sugar signaling molecules, independently from their inter-conversions or use for energy metabolism.;,citation_author=Sabine Kunz;,citation_author=Edouard Pesquet;,citation_author=Leszek A.

Cell death of TEs is a typical example of developmental programmed cell death that has been suggested to be autophagic. However, little evidence of autophagy in TE differentiation has been provided. The present study demonstrates that the small GTP binding protein RabG3b plays a role in TE differentiation through its function in autophagy. Differentiating wild type TE cells were found to undergo autophagy in an Arabidopsis culture system. Both autophagy and TE formation were significantly stimulated by overexpression of a constitutively active mutant (RabG3bCA), and were inhibited in transgenic plants overexpressing a dominant negative mutant (RabG3bDN) or RabG3b RNAi (RabG3bRNAi), a brassinosteroid insensitive mutant bri1-301, and an autophagy mutant atg5-1.

In the worst case, this background signal can overwhelm the weaker Raman signal completely. In this study, the LIF of lignin was investigated with the excitation wavelength 532 nm applied in Raman spectroscopy to clarify the correlations between lignin structure and LIF intensity. Raman spectroscopic analyses with lignin model compounds illustrated that the 5-5\prime structures induce LIF. It was also shown that the intensity of LIF was significantly less intense when the 5-5\prime model compound was structurally rigid (as in dibenzodioxocin) compared with the flexible simple counterpart. The comparison between the free phenolic model compounds with the methylated analogue showed that the presence of the free phenolic structure was not a prerequisite for LIF.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The effect of lignin model compound structure on the rate of oxidation catalyzed by two different fungal laccases;,citation_abstract=Laccases (EC 1.10.3.2) are multicopper oxidases able to oxidize various substrates, such as phenolic subunits of lignin. The substrate range can be widened to non-phenolic units by the use of mediators. Since discovery of the laccase-mediator system, direct reactions of lignin and laccase without mediated electron-transfer have gained much less attention. The objective of this study was to investigate lignin as a substrate for fungal laccases by using lignin model compounds. These model compounds contained guaiacylic and syringylic moieties and also compounds of guaiacylic origin at a higher oxidation level. Some of these compounds are commercially available, but most of them were synthesized. The oxidation reaction rates of the lignin model compounds were studied by monitoring consumption of the co-substrate oxygen, in reactions catalyzed by laccases from two different fungi; Melanocarpus albomyces and Trametes hirsuta, possessing different molecular and catalytic properties. These reaction rate studies were compared to physicochemical properties of the lignin model compounds: relative redox potentials determined using cyclic voltammetry and pKa-values. Docking of syringylic and biphenylic compounds to the active sites of both laccases was performed and the resulting model complex structures were used to further interpret the reaction rate results. Reaction rates of laccases are mainly affected by the ability of a lignin model compound to be oxidized and the pKa-value of the substrate seems to be less important. As a consequence, syringylic compounds are oxidized with the highest rates and compounds at a higher oxidation level and redox-potential, such as vanillin, are oxidized at a much lower rate. Both guaiacylic and syringylic type compounds fit well in the active sites of both laccases. Only for a biphenylic compound, steric clashes were observed, and they are likely to have an effect on the reaction rate. When the oxidation rates on the selected model compounds with the two different laccases were compared, the redox-potential difference between laccases T1 copper and the lignin model compound (??E) was not the only property that determined the oxidation rate. In the case of lignin model substrates, also the selectivity of a specific laccase, reflected in the kcat/Km value, plays an important role. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Disrupting Flavone Synthase II Alters Lignin and Improves Biomass Digestibility;,citation_abstract=Lignin, a ubiquitous phenylpropanoid polymer in vascular plant cell walls, is primarily derived from oxidative couplings of monolignols (p-hydroxycinnamyl alcohols). It was recently discovered that a wide range of grasses, including cereals, utilize a member of flavonoid, tricin (3{\textquoteright},5{\textquoteright}-dimethoxyflavone), as a natural co-monomer with monolignols for cell wall lignification. Previously, we established that cytochrome P450 93G1 is a flavone synthase II (OsFNSII) indispensable for the biosynthesis of soluble tricin-derived metabolites in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Here, our tricin-deficient fnsII mutant was further analyzed with an emphasis on its cell wall structure and properties. The mutant is similar in growth to the wild-type control plants with normal vascular morphology. Chemical and NMR structural analyses demonstrated that the mutant lignin is completely devoid of tricin, indicating that FNSII activity is essential for deposition of tricin-bound lignin in rice cell walls. The mutant also showed substantially reduced lignin content with decreased syringyl/guaiacyl lignin unit composition. Interestingly, the loss of tricin in the mutant lignin appears to be partially compensated by incorporating naringenin which is a preferred substrate of OsFNSII. The fnsII mutant was further revealed to have enhanced enzymatic saccharification efficiency, suggesting that cell wall recalcitrance of grass biomass may be reduced through manipulation of flavonoid monomer supply for lignification.;,citation_author=Pui Ying Lam;,citation_author=Yuki Tobimatsu;,citation_author=Yuri Takeda;,citation_author=Shiro Suzuki;,citation_author=Masaomi Yamamura;,citation_author=Toshiaki Umezawa;,citation_author=Clive Lo;,citation_publication_date=2017;,citation_cover_date=2017;,citation_year=2017;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1104/pp.16.01973;,citation_isbn=0000000264;,citation_issn=0032-0889;,citation_volume=174;,citation_journal_title=Plant Physiol.;">

Hence, assembly and remodeling of the wall is essential in plant development. Most plant cell walls are composed of a framework of cellulose microfibrils that are cross-linked to each other by heteropolysaccharides. The cell walls are highly dynamic and adapt to the changing requirements of the plant during growth. However, despite the importance of plant cell walls for plant growth and for applications that we use in our daily life such as food, feed and fuel, comparatively little is known about how they are synthesized and modified.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Tricin, a Flavonoid Monomer in Monocot Lignification;,citation_abstract=Tricin was recently discovered in lignin preparations from wheat (Triticum aestivum) straw and subsequently in all monocot samples examined. To provide proof that tricin is involved in lignification and establish the mechanism by which it incorporates into the lignin polymer, the 4’-O-\beta-coupling products of tricin with the monolignols (p-coumaryl, coniferyl, and sinapyl alcohols) were synthesized along with the trimer that would result from its 4’-O-\beta-coupling with sinapyl alcohol and then coniferyl alcohol. Tricin was also found to cross couple with monolignols to form tricin-(4’-O-\beta)-linked dimers in biomimetic oxidations using peroxidase/hydrogen peroxide or silver (I) oxide. Nuclear magnetic resonance characterization of gel permeation chromatography-fractionated acetylated maize (Zea mays) lignin revealed that the tricin moieties are found in even the highest molecular weight fractions, ether linked to lignin units, demonstrating that tricin is indeed incorporated into the lignin polymer. These findings suggest that tricin is fully compatible with lignification reactions, is an authentic lignin monomer, and, because it can only start a lignin chain, functions as a nucleation site for lignification in monocots. This initiation role helps resolve a long-standing dilemma that monocot lignin chains do not appear to be initiated by monolignol homodehydrodimerization as they are in dicots that have similar syringyl-guaiacyl compositions. The term flavonolignin is recommended for the racemic oligomers and polymers of monolignols that start from tricin (or incorporate other flavonoids) in the cell wall, in analogy with the existing term flavonolignan that is used for the low-molecular mass compounds composed of flavonoid and lignan moieties.;,citation_author=Wu Lan;,citation_author=Fachuang Lu;,citation_author=Matthew Regner;,citation_author=Yimin Zhu;,citation_author=Jorge Rencoret;,citation_author=Sally A.

It is linked onto lignin as an aryl alkyl ether by radical coupling with monolignols or their acylated analogs. However, the level of tricin that incorporates into lignin remains unclear. Herein, three lignin characterization methods: acidolysis; thioacidolysis; and derivatization followed by reductive cleavage; were applied to quantitatively assess the amount of lignin-integrated tricin. Their efficiencies at cleaving the tricin-(4’-O-beta)-ether bonds and the degradation of tricin under the corresponding reaction conditions were evaluated. A hexadeuterated tricin analog was synthesized as an internal standard for accurate quantitation purposes. Thioacidolysis proved to be the most efficient method, liberating more than 91% of the tricin with little degradation. A survey of different seed-plant species for the occurrence and content of tricin showed that it is widely distributed in the lignin from species in the family Poaceae (order Poales). Tricin occurs at low levels in some commelinid monocotyledon families outside the Poaceae, such as the Arecaceae (the palms, order Arecales) and Bromeliaceae (Poales), and the non-commelinid monocotyledon family Orchidaceae (Orchidales). One eudicotyledon was found to have tricin (Medicago sativa, Fabaceae). The content of lignin-integrated tricin is much higher than the extractable tricin level in all cases. Lignins, including waste lignin streams from biomass processing, could therefore provide a large and alternative source of this valuable flavone, reducing the costs, and encouraging studies into its application beyond its current roles.;,citation_author=Wu Lan;,citation_author=Jorge Rencoret;,citation_author=Fachuang Lu;,citation_author=Steven D.

To elucidate the incorporation pathways of tricin into grass lignin, the metabolites of maize (Zea mays) were extracted from lignifying tissues and profiled using the recently developed ’candidate substrate product pair’ algorithm applied to ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography and Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance-mass spectrometry. Twelve tricin-containing products (each with up to eight isomers), including those derived from the various monolignol acetate and p-coumarate conjugates, were observed and authenticated by comparisons with a set of synthetic tricin-oligolignol dimeric and trimeric compounds. The identification of such compounds helps establish that tricin is an important monomer in the lignification of monocots, acting as a nucleation site for starting lignin chains.

Carbohydrate (about 14%, w/w) and protein (about 32%, w/w) were also detected. Amino acid analysis revealed that hydroxyproline and proline predominated. Thioacidolysis and subsequent Raney nickel desulfurization allowed the analysis of lignin-building units and interunit bonds. Compared with spruce wood lignin, an approximately 20-fold higher relative amount of p-hydroxyphenyl units was determined. A high content of p-hydroxyphenyl units is typical for certain developmental lignins, such as conifer compression wood and middle lamella lignins, as well as all induced cell culture lignins so far analyzed. Cross-linkages of the pinoresinol type ([beta]-[beta]) in the excreted cell culture lignin were markedly increased, whereas [beta]-1 interunit linkages were decreased relative to spruce wood lignin.

In Arabidopsis, a small cluster of three closely related genes, UGT72E1–E3, encode glycosyltransferases shown to glucosylate several phenylpropanoids in vitro, including monolignols, hydroxycinnamic acids and hydroxycinnamic aldehydes. The role of these genes in planta has now been investigated through genetically downregulating the expression of individual genes or silencing the entire cluster. Analysis of these transgenic Arabidopsis plants showed that the levels of coniferyl and sinapyl alcohol 4-O-glucosides that accumulate in light-grown roots were significantly reduced. A 50% reduction in both glucosides was observed in plants in which UGT72E2 was downregulated, whereas silencing the three genes led to a 90% reduction, suggesting some redundancy of function within the cluster. The gene encoding UGT72E2 was constitutively overexpressed in transgenic Arabidopsis to determine whether increased glucosylation of monolignols could influence flux through the soluble phenylpropanoid pathway. Elevated expression of UGT72E2 led to increased accumulation of monolignol glucosides in root tissues and also the appearance of these glucosides in leaves. In particular, coniferyl alcohol 4-O-glucoside accumulated to massive amounts (10 \mumol g-1 FW) in root tissues of these plants. Increased glucosylation of other phenylpropanoids also occurred in plants overexpressing this glycosyltransferase. Significantly changing the pattern of glycosides in the leaves also led to a pronounced change in accumulation of the hydroxycinnamic ester sinapoyl malate. The data demonstrate the plasticity of phenylpropanoid metabolism and the important role that glucosylation of secondary metabolites can play in cellular homeostasis.;,citation_author=Alexandra Lanot;,citation_author=Denise Hodge;,citation_author=Rosamond G.

Among the lignin-derived monomers, the indene compounds that were recently shown to originate from sinapaldehyde incorporated into lignins through 8–O–4-cross-coupling, were found to increase as a function of CAD deficiency level. While these syringyl markers were recovered in substantial amounts in the most severely depressed lines, the markers for coniferaldehyde incorporation were recovered in only low amounts. In conjunction with these additional sinapaldehyde units and relative to the control samples, lignins in CAD-deficient poplar lines had less conventional syringyl-units and \beta–O–4-bonds and more free phenolic groups. We found that almost half of the polymers in the most deficient lines could be solubilized in alkali and at room temperature. This unusual behavior suggests that lignins in CAD-deficient poplars occur as small, alkali-leachable lignin domains. That mainly sinapaldehyde incorporates into the lignins of CAD-deficient poplars suggests that the recently identified sinapyl alcohol dehydrogenase (SAD), which is structurally distinct from the CAD enzyme targeted herein, does not play any substantial role in constitutive lignification in poplar.;,citation_author=Catherine Lapierre;,citation_author=Gilles Pilate;,citation_author=Brigitte Pollet;,citation_author=Isabelle Mila;,citation_author=Jean-Charles Leplé;,citation_author=Lise Jouanin;,citation_author=Hoon Kim;,citation_author=John Ralph;,citation_publication_date=2004-02;,citation_cover_date=2004-02;,citation_year=2004;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.phytochem.2003.11.007;,citation_issn=0031-9422;,citation_volume=65;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Phytochemistry;">

Lignin and Lignans: Advances in Chemistry captures the developments that have been achieved by world-class scientists in the most critical aspects of this burgeoning field. Tools for the characterization of lignin and lignans After an overview of the topic, the book discusses the significance and comparative performances of the most commonly used chemical degradation methods and presents lignin structural information based on the use of these methods. Next, the book explores spectroscopic methods, including UV-visible absorption, fluorescence, Raman, infra red (IR), near-infrared (NIR), nuclear magenetic resonance (NMR), and heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy. It then compares the results of studies of lignin in situ with studies of isolated lignins. Predicting reactivity The authors discuss polymer properties related to thermal stability and molecular motion of lignin in the solid state. They describe applications of electronic structure calculations to the chemistry of lignin, and they explore lignin reactions that occur during the chemical pulping of wood by soda, kraft, AQ, and polysulfide processes. Chemistry associated with industrial processes The book describes chemical pulp bleaching, oxidative and reductive lignin-retaining bleaching, and lignin biodegradation. It also examines the application of microorganisms and the enzymes they produce in the manufacturing of chemical and mechanical pulp. The book closes with chapters on photodegradation and chromophore formation and the pharmacological properties of lignans.

Here, we analyzed transgenic poplars (Populus tremula  Populus alba) expressing the Brachypodium (Brachypodium distachyon) p-coumaroyl-Coenzyme A monolignol transferase 1 (BdPMT1) gene driven by the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) Cinnamate 4-Hydroxylase (AtC4H) promoter in the wild-type (WT) line and in a line overexpressing the Arabidopsis Ferulate 5-Hydroxylase (AtF5H). BdPMT1 encodes a transferase which catalyzes the acylation of monolignols by p-coumaric acid (pCA). Several BdPMT1-OE/WT and BdPMT1-OE/AtF5H-OE lines were grown in the greenhouse, and BdPMT1 expression in xylem was confirmed by RT-PCR. Analyses of poplar stem cell walls (CWs) and of the corresponding purified dioxan lignins (DLs) revealed that BdPMT1-OE lignins were as p-coumaroylated as lignins from C3 grass straws. For some transformants, pCA levels reached 11 mg\cdotg-1 CW and 66 mg\cdotg-1 DL, exceeding levels in Brachypodium or wheat (Triticum aestivum) samples. This unprecedentedly high lignin p-coumaroylation affected neither poplar growth nor stem lignin content. Interestingly, p-coumaroylation of poplar lignins was not favored in BdPMT1-OE/AtF5H-OE transgenic lines despite their high frequency of syringyl units. However, lignins of all BdPMT1-OE lines were structurally modified, with an increase of terminal unit with free phenolic groups. Relative to controls, this increase argues for a reduced polymerization degree of BdPMT1-OE lignins and makes them more soluble in cold NaOH solution. The p-coumaroylation of poplar samples improved the saccharification yield of alkali-pretreated CW, demonstrating that the genetically driven p-coumaroylation of lignins is a promising strategy to make wood lignins more susceptible to alkaline treatments used during the industrial processing of lignocellulosics.;,citation_author=Catherine Lapierre;,citation_author=Richard Sibout;,citation_author=Françoise Laurans;,citation_author=Marie-Claude Lesage-Descauses;,citation_author=Annabelle Déjardin;,citation_author=Gilles Pilate;,citation_publication_date=2021-11;,citation_cover_date=2021-11;,citation_year=2021;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1093/plphys/kiab359;,citation_issn=0032-0889;,citation_volume=187;,citation_journal_title=Plant Physiol.;">

Density functional theory combined with the polarizable continuum model were applied to assign the observed bands and tested for prediction accuracy.

Here, we report the characterisation of two functionally and structurally distinct cDNA clones, AtCCR1 and AtCCR2 (81.6% protein sequence identity) in Arabidopsis thaliana. The two recombinant proteins expressed in Escherichia coli are able to use the three cinnamoyl-CoAs tested but with different levels of efficiency. AtCCR1 is five times more efficient with feruloyl-CoA and sinapoyl-CoA than AtCCR2. In addition, the two genes are differentially expressed during development and in response to infection. AtCCR1 is preferentially expressed in tissues undergoing lignification. In contrast, AtCCR2, which is poorly expressed during development, is strongly and transiently induced during the incompatible interaction with Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris leading to a hypersensitive response. Altogether, these data suggest that AtCCR1 is involved in constitutive lignification whereas AtCCR2 is involved in the biosynthesis of phenolics whose accumulation may lead to resistance. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.;,citation_author=Virginie Lauvergeat;,citation_author=Christophe Lacomme;,citation_author=Eric Lacombe;,citation_author=Eric Lasserre;,citation_author=Dominique Roby;,citation_author=Jacqueline Grima-Pettenati;,citation_publication_date=2001;,citation_cover_date=2001;,citation_year=2001;,citation_issue=7;,citation_doi=10.1016/S0031-9422(01)00053-X;,citation_isbn=0031-9422 (Print){\textbackslash}r0031-9422 (Linking);,citation_issn=00319422;,citation_pmid=11430991;,citation_volume=57;,citation_journal_title=Phytochemistry;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Association of Arabidopsis type-II ROPs with the plasma membrane requires a conserved C-terminal sequence motif and a proximal polybasic domain;,citation_abstract=Plant ROPs (or RACs) are soluble Ras-related small GTPases that are attached to cell membranes by virtue of the post-translational lipid modifications of prenylation and S-acylation. ROPs (RACs) are subdivided into two major subgroups called type-I and type-II. Whereas type-I ROPs terminate with a conserved CaaL box and undergo prenylation, type-II ROPs undergo S-acylation on two or three C-terminal cysteines. In the present work we determined the sequence requirement for association of Arabidopsis type-II ROPs with the plasma membrane. We identified a conserved sequence motif, designated the GC-CG box, in which the modified cysteines are flanked by glycines. The GC-CG box cysteines are separated by five to six mostly non-polar residues. Deletion of this sequence or the introduction of mutations that change its nature disrupted the association of ROPs with the membrane. Mutations that changed the GC-CG box glycines to alanines also interfered with membrane association. Deletion of a polybasic domain proximal to the GC-CG box disrupted the plasma membrane association of AtROP10. A green fluorescent protein fusion protein containing the C-terminal 25 residues of AtROP10, including its polybasic domain and GC-CG box, was primarily associated with the plasma membrane but a similar fusion protein lacking the polybasic domain was exclusively localized in the soluble fraction.

To obtain an understanding of the differences in lignin structure and reactivity within the various LCC fractions, thioacidolysis in combination with gas chromatography was used to quantify the content of \beta-O-4 structures in the lignin. Periodate oxidation followed by determination of methanol was used to quantify the phenolic hydroxyl groups. Furthermore, size exclusion chromatography (SEC) of the thioacidolysis fractions was used to monitor any differences between the original molecular size distribution and that after the delignification processes. Characteristic differences between the various LCC fractions were observed, clearly indicating that two different forms of lignin are present in the wood fiber wall. These forms are linked to glucomannan and xylan, respectively. On pulping, the different LCCs have different reactivities. The xylan-linked lignin is to a large extent degraded, whereas the glucomannan-linked lignin undergoes a partial condensation to form more high molecular mass material. The latter seems to be rather unchanged during a subsequent oxygen-delignification stage.

Multiple studies have investigated the effect of pyrosequencing read quality on operational taxonomic unit (OTU) richness for contrived communities, yet there is limited information on the fidelity of community structure estimates obtained through this approach. Given that PCR biases are widely recognized, and further unknown biases may arise from the sequencing process itself, a priori assumptions about the neutrality of the data generation process are at best unvalidated. Furthermore, post-sequencing quality control algorithms have not been explicitly evaluated for the accuracy of recovered representative sequences and its impact on downstream analyses, reducing useful discussion on pyrosequencing reads to their diversity and abundances. Here we report on community structures and sequences recovered for in vitro-simulated communities consisting of twenty 16S rRNA gene clones tiered at known proportions. PCR amplicon libraries of the V3-V4 and V6 hypervariable regions from the in vitro-simulated communities were sequenced using the Roche 454 GS FLX Titanium platform. Commonly used quality control protocols resulted in the formation of OTUs with &amp;amp;amp;gt;1% abundance composed entirely of erroneous sequences, while over-aggressive clustering approaches obfuscated real, expected OTUs. The pyrosequencing process itself did not appear to impose significant biases on overall community structure estimates, although the detection limit for rare taxa may be affected by PCR amplicon size and quality control approach employed. Meanwhile, PCR biases associated with the initial amplicon generation may impose greater distortions in the observed community structure.;,citation_author=Charles K. Lee;,citation_author=Craig W.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A mechanism for localized lignin deposition in the endodermis;,citation_abstract=The precise localization of extracellular matrix and cell wall components is of critical importance for multicellular organisms. Lignin is a major cell wall modification that often forms intricate subcellular patterns that are central to cellular function. Yet the mechanisms of lignin polymerization and the subcellular precision of its formation remain enigmatic. Here, we show that the Casparian strip, a lignin-based, paracellular diffusion barrier in plants, forms as a precise, median ring by the concerted action of a specific, localized NADPH oxidase, brought into proximity of localized peroxidases through the action of Casparian strip domain proteins (CASPs). Our findings in Arabidopsis provide a simple mechanistic model of how plant cells regulate lignin formation with subcellular precision. We speculate that scaffolding of NADPH oxidases to the downstream targets of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) that they produce might be a widespread mechanism to ensure specificity and subcellular precision of ROS action within the extracellular matrix. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.;,citation_author=Yuree Lee;,citation_author=Maria C.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Identification of lignin-deficient Brachypodium distachyon (L.) Beauv. Mutants induced by gamma radiation;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND Brachypodium distachyon (L.) Beauv. is a monocotyledonous model plant that has been studied to understand a range of biological phenomena for lignocellulosic bioethanol feedstocks and other cereal crops. The lignin makes its cell walls recalcitrant to saccharification, constituting the main barrier to lignocellulosic bioethanol production. In this study, lignin-deficient mutants of B. distachyon induced by chronic radiation were selected and the effects of the mutants on fermentable glucose production were identified. RESULTS Brachypodium distachyon M2 mutants induced by chronically irradiated gamma radiation were screened by the Wiesner test. Lignin-deficient M2 mutants were further confirmed in subsequent M3 and M4 generations by determining acetyl bromide-soluble lignin. The lignin content was significantly reduced in mutant plants 135-2 (by 7.99%), 142-3 (by 13.8%) and 406-1 (by 8.13%) compared with the wild type. Moreover, fermentable glucose was significantly higher in 135-2 (by 23.91%) and 142-3 (by 36.72%) than in the wild type after 72 h of enzymatic hydrolysis. CONCLUSION Three lignin-deficient B. distachyon mutants induced by chronically irradiated gamma radiation were obtained. This study will provide fundamental understanding of the B. distachyon cell wall and could contribute to increases in bioethanol production using bioenergy crops. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry;,citation_author=Man Bo Lee;,citation_author=Jae Yoon Kim;,citation_author=Yong Weon Seo;,citation_publication_date=2017;,citation_cover_date=2017;,citation_year=2017;,citation_issue=7;,citation_doi=10.1002/jsfa.8024;,citation_issn=1097-0010;,citation_volume=97;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=J.

CASPs are known to be the organizers of the lignin-based Casparian strip, which functions as a diffusion barrier in roots.

One such tool that has gained significant traction in the biological sciences is structural equation models (SEM), a form of path analysis that resolves complex multivariate relationships among a suite of interrelated variables. Evaluation of SEMs has historically relied on covariances among variables, rather than the values of the data points themselves. While this approach permits a wide variety of model forms, it limits the incorporation of detailed specifications. Recent developments have allowed for the simultaneous implementation of non-normal distributions, random effects and different correlation structures using local estimation, but this process is not yet automated and consequently, evaluation can be prohibitive with complex models. Here, I present a fully documented, open-source package piecewiseSEM, a practical implementation of confirmatory path analysis for the r programming language. The package extends this method to all current (generalized) linear, (phylogenetic) least-square, and mixed effects models, relying on familiar r syntax. I also provide two worked examples: one involving random effects and temporal autocorrelation, and a second involving phylogenetically independent contrasts.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Fpocket: An open source platform for ligand pocket detection;,citation_abstract=Background Virtual screening methods start to be well established as effective approaches to identify hits, candidates and leads for drug discovery research. Among those, structure based virtual screening (SBVS) approaches aim at docking collections of small compounds in the target structure to identify potent compounds. For SBVS, the identification of candidate pockets in protein structures is a key feature, and the recent years have seen increasing interest in developing methods for pocket and cavity detection on protein surfaces. Results Fpocket is an open source pocket detection package based on Voronoi tessellation and alpha spheres built on top of the publicly available package Qhull. The modular source code is organised around a central library of functions, a basis for three main programs: (i) Fpocket, to perform pocket identification, (ii) Tpocket, to organise pocket detection benchmarking on a set of known protein-ligand complexes, and (iii) Dpocket, to collect pocket descriptor values on a set of proteins. Fpocket is written in the C programming language, which makes it a platform well suited for the scientific community willing to develop new scoring functions and extract various pocket descriptors on a large scale level. Fpocket 1.0, relying on a simple scoring function, is able to detect 94% and 92% of the pockets within the best three ranked pockets from the holo and apo proteins respectively, outperforming the standards of the field, while being faster.

Arabidopsis thaliana GH9A1/KORRIGAN1 is a membrane-bound, family 9 glycosyl hydrolase that is important for cellulose synthesis in both primary and secondary cell walls. Most previously identified korrigan1 mutants show severe phenotypes such as embryo lethality; therefore, the role of GH9A1 in cellulose synthesis remains unclear. Here, we report a novel A577V missense mutation, designated jiaoyao1 (jia1), in the second of the glycosyl hydrolase family 9 active site signature motifs in GH9A1. jia1 is defective in cell expansion in dark-grown hypocotyls, roots, and adult plants. Consistent with its defect in cell expansion, this mutation in GH9A1 resulted in reduced cellulose content and reduced CSC velocity at the plasma membrane. Green fluorescent protein–GH9A1 is associated with CSCs at multiple locations, including the plasma membrane, Golgi, trans-Golgi network, and small CESA-containing compartments or microtubule-associated cellulose synthase compartments, indicating a tight association between GH9A1 and CSCs. GH9A1A577V abolishes the endoglucanase activity of GH9A1 in vitro but does not affect its interaction with CESAs in vitro, suggesting that endoglucanase activity is important for cellulose synthesis.

Cellulose biosynthesis is a tightly regulated process that is performed by plasma membrane-localized cellulose synthase (CESA) complexes (CSCs). However, the regulatory mechanism of cellulose biosynthesis under abiotic stress has not been well explored. In this study, we show that small CESA compartments (SmaCCs) or microtubule-associated cellulose synthase compartments (MASCs) are critical for fast recovery of CSCs to the plasma membrane after stress is relieved in Arabidopsis thaliana. This SmaCC/MASC-mediated fast recovery of CSCs is dependent on CELLULOSE SYNTHASE INTERACTIVE1 (CSI1), a protein previously known to represent the link between CSCs and cortical microtubules. Independently, AP2M, a core component in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, plays a role in the formation of SmaCCs/MASCs.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Developmental control and plasticity of fruit and seed dimorphism in aethionema arabicum;,citation_abstract=Understanding how plants cope with changing habitats is a timely and important topic in plant research. Phenotypic plasticity describes the capability of a genotype to produce different phenotypes when exposed to different environmental conditions. In contrast, the constant production of a set of distinct phenotypes by one genotype mediates bet hedging, a strategy that reduces the temporal variance in fitness at the expense of a lowered arithmetic mean fitness. Both phenomena are thought to represent important adaptation strategies to unstable environments. However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms of these phenomena, partly due to the lack of suitable model systems. We used phylogenetic and comparative analyses of fruit and seed anatomy, biomechanics, physiology, and environmental responses to study fruit and seed heteromorphism, a typical morphological basis of a bet-hedging strategy of plants, in the annual Brassicaceae species Aethionema arabicum. Our results indicate that heteromorphism evolved twice within the Aethionemeae, including once for the monophyletic annual Aethionema clade. The dimorphism of Ae. arabicum is associated with several anatomic, biomechanical, gene expression, and physiological differences between the fruit and seed morphs. However, fruit ratios and numbers change in response to different environmental conditions. Therefore, the life-history strategy of Ae. arabicum appears to be a blend of bet hedging and plasticity. Together with the available genomic resources, our results pave the way to use this species in future studies intended to unravel the molecular control of heteromorphism and plasticity.;,citation_author=Teresa Lenser;,citation_author=Kai Graeber;,citation_author=Özge Selin Cevik;,citation_author=Nezaket Adigüzel;,citation_author=Ali A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=When the BRANCHED network bears fruit: How carpic dominance causes fruit dimorphism in aethionema;,citation_abstract=Life in unpredictably changing habitats is a great challenge, especially for sessile organisms like plants. Fruit and seed heteromorphism is one way to cope with such variable environmental conditions. It denotes the production of distinct types of fruits and seeds that often mediate distinct life-history strategies in terms of dispersal, germination and seedling establishment. But although the phenomenon can be found in numerous species and apparently evolved several times independently, its developmental time course or molecular regulation remains largely unknown. Here, we studied fruit development in Aethionema arabicum, a dimorphic member of the Brassicaceae family. We characterized fruit morph differentiation by comparatively analyzing discriminating characters like fruit growth, seed abortion and dehiscence zone development. Our data demonstrate that fruit morph determination is a “last-minute” decision happening in flowers after anthesis directly before the first morphotypical differences start to occur. Several growth experiments in combination with hormone and gene expression analyses further indicate that an accumulation balance of the plant hormones auxin and cytokinin in open flowers together with the transcript abundance of the Ae. arabicum ortholog of BRANCHED1, encoding a transcription factor known for its conserved function as a branching repressor, may guide fruit morph determination. Thus, we hypothesize that the plasticity of the fruit morph ratio in Ae. arabicum may have evolved through the modification of a preexisting network known to govern correlative dominance between shoot organs.;,citation_author=Teresa Lenser;,citation_author=Danuše Tarkowská;,citation_author=Ondřej Novák;,citation_author=Per K.

Thioacidolysis, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), immunocytochemistry of lignin epitopes, and oligolignol profiling indicated that lignin was relatively more reduced in syringyl than in guaiacyl units. The cohesion of the walls was affected, particularly at sites that are generally richer in syringyl units in wild-type poplar. Ferulic acid was incorporated into the lignin via ether bonds, as evidenced independently by thioacidolysis and by NMR. A synthetic lignin incorporating ferulic acid had a red-brown coloration, suggesting that the xylem coloration was due to the presence of ferulic acid during lignification. Elevated ferulic acid levels were also observed in the form of esters. Transcript and metabolite profiling were used as comprehensive phenotyping tools to investigate how CCR downregulation impacted metabolism and the biosynthesis of other cell wall polymers. Both methods suggested reduced biosynthesis and increased breakdown or remodeling of noncellulosic cell wall polymers, which was further supported by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and wet chemistry analysis. The reduced levels of lignin and hemicellulose were associated with an increased proportion of cellulose. Furthermore, the transcript and metabolite profiling data pointed toward a stress response induced by the altered cell wall structure. Finally, chemical pulping of wood derived from 5-year-old, field-grown transgenic lines revealed improved pulping characteristics, but growth was affected in all transgenic lines tested.;,citation_author=J.-C.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The elongation Defective1 mutant of Arabidopsis is impaired in the gene encoding a serine-rich secreted protein;,citation_abstract=Coordinated cell growth and differentiation is crucial for the development of higher plants. Using the elongation defective 1-1 (eld1-1) mutant, we cloned the ELD1 gene, which encodes a serine-rich protein. Genes homologous to ELD1 can be found in plants, includingArabidopsis, rice, and tobacco, but not in other organisms. Using reverse genetics, we identified a new allele, eld1-2, which is phenotypically indistinguishable from eld1-1, but does not produce a detectable ELD1 transcript. The ELD1 gene sequence is the same as that of the KOBITO1 sequence. However, the kob1 mutants display weak phenotype relative to the two eld1 mutants, which are likely null alleles. KOB1 was reported to be a membrane protein involved in cellulose synthesis. However, based on ELD1-GFP localization in plasmolyzed cells, we found that ELD1 is localized to the cell wall/extracellular matrix, rather than the membrane. Thus, ELD1/KOB1 is a secreted protein involved in promoting cell growth. To investigate the relationship between ELD1 and Arabidopsis genes with high sequence similarity, we analyzed the possible subcellular location of their proteins as well as their amino acid sequence. The ELD1-related proteins in Arabidopsis were predicted to be localized to subcellular compartments different from that of ELD1. Thus, ELD1 is likely to be functionally distinct from related Arabidopsis genes. These results suggest that ELD1 is a single-copy gene which belongs to a small family of plant-specific genes with diverse function.;,citation_author=Kvin Lertpiriyapong;,citation_author=Zinmay Renee Sung;,citation_publication_date=2003-11;,citation_cover_date=2003-11;,citation_year=2003;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1023/B:PLAN.0000019067.05185.d6;,citation_issn=1573-5028;,citation_volume=53;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Plant Mol.

The latter covers the active site, thereby maintaining the enzyme in a latent state. Activation can be achieved with SDS but little is known about the mechanism. We prepared domain-swap variants of dandelion PPO-1 and PPO-2 to test the specific functions of individual domains and their impact on enzyme characteristics. Our experiments revealed that the C-terminal domain modulates the pH optimum curve and has a strong influence on the optimal pH value. The linker determines the SDS concentration required for full activation. It also influences the SDS concentration required for half maximal activation (k&amp;amp;amp;lt;inf&amp;gt;SDS&amp;lt;/inf&amp;gt;) and the stability of the enzyme during prolonged incubation in buffers containing SDS, but the N-terminal domain has the strongest effect on these parameters. The N-terminal domain also determines the IC<inf>50</inf> of SDS and the stability in buffers containing or lacking SDS. We propose that the linker and C-terminal domain fine-tune the activation of plant PPOs. The C-terminal domain adjusts the pH optimum and the linker probably contains an SDS-binding/interaction site that influences inactivation and determines the SDS concentration required for activation. For the first time, we have determined the influence of the three PPO domains on enzyme activation and stability providing insight into the regulation and activation mechanisms of type-3 copper proteins in general.;,citation_author=Christine M.

Here, we report the isolation of a novel aspen gene (PtSAD) encoding sinapyl alcohol dehydrogenase (SAD), which is phylogenetically distinct from aspen CAD (PtCAD). Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry-based enzyme functional analysis and substrate level–controlled enzyme kinetics consistently demonstrated that PtSAD is sinapaldehyde specific and that PtCAD is coniferaldehyde specific. The enzymatic efficiency of PtSAD for sinapaldehyde was \sim60 times greater than that of PtCAD. These data suggest that in addition to CAD, discrete SAD function is essential to the biosynthesis of syringyl monolignol in angiosperms. In aspen stem primary tissues, PtCAD was immunolocalized exclusively to xylem elements in which only guaiacyl lignin was deposited, whereas PtSAD was abundant in syringyl lignin–enriched phloem fiber cells. In the developing secondary stem xylem, PtCAD was most conspicuous in guaiacyl lignin–enriched vessels, but PtSAD was nearly absent from these elements and was conspicuous in fiber cells. In the context of additional protein immunolocalization and lignin histochemistry, these results suggest that the distinct CAD and SAD functions are linked spatiotemporally to the differential biosynthesis of guaiacyl and syringyl lignins in different cell types.

MetAP carries out this cleavage with high precision, and Met is the only natural amino acid residue at the N terminus that is accepted, although type I and type II MetAPs use two different sets of residues to form the hydrophobic S1 site. Characteristics of the S1 binding pocket in type I MetAP were investigated by systematic mutation of each of the seven S1 residues in Escherichia coli MetAP type I (EcMetAP1) and human MetAP type I (HsMetAP1). We found that Tyr-65 and Trp-221 in EcMetAP1, as well as the corresponding residues Phe-197 and Trp-352 in HsMetAP1, were essential for the hydrolysis of a thiopeptolide substrate, Met-S-Gly-Phe. Mutation of Phe-191 to Ala in HsMetAP1 caused inactivity in contrast to the full activity of EcMetAP1(Y62A), which may suggest a subtle difference between the two type I enzymes. The more striking finding is that mutation of Cys-70 in EcMetAP1 or Cys-202 in HsMetAP1 opens up the S1 pocket. The thiopeptolides Leu-S-Gly-Phe and Phe-S-Gly-Phe, with previously unacceptable Leu or Phe as the N-terminal residue, became efficient substrates of EcMetAP1(C70A) and HsMetAP1(C202A). The relaxed specificity shown in these S1 site mutants for the N-terminal residues was confirmed by hydrolysis of peptide substrates and inhibition by reaction products.

Insect PO is activated from its inactive precursor, prophenoloxidase (PPO), by specific proteolysis via a serine protease cascade. Here, we report the crystal structure of PPO from a lepidopteran insect at a resolution of 1.97 A, which is the initial structure for a PPO from the type 3 copper protein family. Manduca sexta PPO is a heterodimer consisting of 2 homologous polypeptide chains, PPO1 and PPO2. The active site of each subunit contains a canonical type 3 di-nuclear copper center, with each copper ion coordinated with 3 structurally conserved histidines. The acidic residue Glu-395 located at the active site of PPO2 may serve as a general base for deprotonation of monophenolic substrates, which is key to the ortho-hydroxylase activity of PO. The structure provides unique insights into the mechanism by which type 3 copper proteins differ in their enzymatic activities, albeit sharing a common active center. A drastic change in electrostatic surface induced on cleavage at Arg-51 allows us to propose a model for localized PPO activation in insects.;,citation_author=Y. Li;,citation_author=Y.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Understanding Lignification: Challenges Beyond Monolignol Biosynthesis;,citation_abstract=Lignin, a major component of vascular plant cell wall, provides mechanical support for plants to stand upright and enables xylems to withstand the negative pressure generated during water transport. Although important for plant growth, the presence of lignin limits access to cell wall polysaccharides and thereby negatively affects human utilization of biomass such as its use as livestock feed, in paper manufacturing, and in lignocellulosic biofuel production. Because of its significant economic impact, lignin has been one of the most intensively studied subjects in plant biochemistry. Lignin is a heterogeneous phenolic polymer largely composed of three major types of monomers (monolignols), p-coumaryl, coniferyl, and sinapyl alcohols. During lignin deposition, monolignols are synthesized in the cytoplasm, translocated to the apoplast, and polymerized into lignin. Over the last two decades, the biosynthesis of monolignols has been a major focus of research on lignification. We now believe that the monolignol biosynthetic pathway has been relatively well elucidated, at least in angiosperms. Based upon this knowledge, genetic engineering approaches have been used to successfully modify lignin content and/or composition in a variety of plant species (for review, see Boerjan et al., 2003; Li et al., 2008). Despite these advances, there remain significant gaps in our knowledge of the lignification process. Little is known about how monolignols are transported through the cell membrane to their polymerization sites. Neither are the catalysts involved in the polymerization process itself well understood. It is also unknown how lignification is restricted to certain regions within the cell wall of a single cell. In addition, it is still unclear how and why perturbation of lignification affects plant growth, an issue that must be addressed if lignin modification is to be successfully applied to the improvement of biofuel crops. Recent reports of the presence of lignin in nonvascular plants and red algae, as well as the identification of alternative routes for lignin monomer biosynthesis in nonangiosperms raise important questions about lignin evolution (Martone et al., 2009; Espiñeira et al., 2010; Weng et al., 2010). In summary, there are still great challenges in lignin research. In this article, we will focus our discussion on important topics that are poised to become the new frontiers in lignin research.;,citation_author=X.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Four Isoforms of Arabidopsis 4-Coumarate:CoA Ligase Have Overlapping yet Distinct Roles in Phenylpropanoid Metabolism;,citation_abstract=The biosynthesis of lignin, flavonoids and hydroxycinnamoyl esters share the first three enzymatic steps of the phenylpropanoid pathway. The last shared step is catalyzed by 4-coumarate: CoA ligase (4CL), which generates p-coumaroyl CoA and caffeoyl CoA from their respective acids. Four isoforms of 4CL have been identified in Arabidopsis thaliana. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that 4CL1, 4CL2 and 4CL4 are more closely related to each other than to 4CL3, suggesting that the two groups may serve different biological functions. Promoter-GUS analysis shows that 4CL1 and 4CL2 are expressed in lignifying cells. In contrast, 4CL3 is expressed in a broad range of cell types and 4CL3 has acquired a distinct role in flavonoid metabolism. Sinapoylmalate, the major hydroxycinnamoyl ester found in Arabidopsis, is greatly reduced in a 4cl1 4cl3 mutant, showing that 4CL1 and 4CL3 function redundantly in its biosynthesis. 4CL1 accounts for the majority of the total 4CL activity and loss of 4CL1 leads to reduction in lignin content but no growth defect. The 4cl1 4cl2 and the 4cl1 4cl2 4cl3 mutants are both dwarf but do not have further reduced lignin than the 4cl1 mutant, indicating that one of 4CL1 or 4CL2 is required for normal plant growth. Although 4CL4 has a limited expression profile, it does make a modest contribution to lignin biosynthesis.

Fine-mapping analysis of bm4 narrowed the candidate region to an approximately 105 kb interval on chromosome 9 containing six genes. Only one of these six genes, GRMZM2G393334, showed decreased expression in mutants. At least four of 10 Mu-induced bm4 mutant alleles contain a Mu insertion in the GRMZM2G393334 gene. Based on these results, we concluded that GRMZM2G393334 is the bm4 gene. GRMZM2G393334 encodes a putative folylpolyglutamate synthase (FPGS), which functions in one-carbon (C1) metabolism to polyglutamylate substrates of folate-dependent enzymes. Yeast complementation experiments demonstrated that expression of the maize bm4 gene in FPGS-deficient met7 yeast is able to rescue the yeast mutant phenotype, thus demonstrating that bm4 encodes a functional FPGS. Consistent with earlier studies, bm4 mutants exhibit a modest decrease in lignin concentration and an overall increase in the S:G lignin ratio relative to wild-type. Orthologs of bm4 include at least one paralogous gene in maize and various homologs in other grasses and dicots.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=High-level hemicellulosic arabinose predominately affects lignocellulose crystallinity for genetically enhancing both plant lodging resistance and biomass enzymatic digestibility in rice mutants;,citation_abstract=Rice is a major food crop with enormous biomass residue for biofuels. As plant cell wall recalcitrance basically decides a costly biomass process, genetic modification of plant cell walls has been regarded as a promising solution. However, due to structural complexity and functional diversity of plant cell walls, it becomes essential to identify the key factors of cell wall modifications that could not much alter plant growth, but cause an enhancement in biomass enzymatic digestibility. To address this issue, we performed systems biology analyses of a total of 36 distinct cell wall mutants of rice. As a result, cellulose crystallinity (CrI) was examined to be the key factor that negatively determines either the biomass enzymatic saccharification upon various chemical pretreatments or the plant lodging resistance, an integrated agronomic trait in plant growth and grain production. Notably, hemicellulosic arabinose (Ara) was detected to be the major factor that negatively affects cellulose CrI probably through its interlinking with \beta-1,4-glucans.

Further characterization of two elite mutants, Osfc17 and Osfc30, showing normal plant growth and high biomass enzymatic digestion in situ and in vitro, revealed the multiple GH9B candidate genes for reducing cellulose CrI and XAT genes for increasing hemicellulosic Ara level.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Signal transduction and regulation of IbpreproHypSys in sweet potato;,citation_abstract=Hydroxyproline-rich glycopeptides (HypSys) are small signalling peptides containing 18-20 amino acids. The expression of IbpreproHypSys, encoding the precursor of IbHypSys, was induced in sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas cv. Tainung 57) through wounding and IbHypSys treatments by using jasmonate and H2 O2 . Transgenic sweet potatoes overexpressing (OE) and silencing [RNA interference (RNAi)] IbpreproHypSys were created. The expression of the wound-inducible gene for ipomoelin (IPO) in the local and systemic leaves of OE plants was stronger than the expression in wild-type (WT) and RNAi plants after wounding. Furthermore, grafting experiments indicated that IPO expression was considerably higher in WT stocks receiving wounding signals from OE than from RNAi scions. However, wounding WT scions highly induced IPO expression in OE stocks. These results indicated that IbpreproHypSys expression contributed towards sending and receiving the systemic signals that induced IPO expression. Analysing the genes involved in the phenylpropanoid pathway demonstrated that lignin biosynthesis was activated after synthetic IbHypSys treatment. IbpreproHypSys expression in sweet potato suppressed Spodoptera litura growth. In conclusion, wounding induced the expression of IbpreproHypSys, whose protein product was processed into IbHypSys.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Current Understanding of the Correlation of Lignin Structure with Biomass Recalcitrance;,citation_abstract=Lignin, a complex aromatic polymer in terrestrial plants, contributes significantly to biomass recalcitrance to microbial and/or enzymatic deconstruction. To reduce biomass recalcitrance, substantial endeavors have been exerted on pretreatment and lignin engineering in the past few decades. Lignin removal and/or alteration of lignin structure have been shown to result in reduced biomass recalcitrance with improved cell wall digestibility. While high lignin content is usually a barrier to a cost-efficient application of bioresources to biofuels, the direct correlation of lignin structure and its concomitant properties with biomass remains unclear due to the complexity of cell wall and lignin structure. Advancement in application of biorefinery to production of biofuels, chemicals, and bio-derived materials necessitates a fundamental understanding of the relationship of lignin structure and biomass recalcitrance. In this mini-review, we focus on recent investigations on the influence of lignin chemical properties on bioprocessability-pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis of biomass. Specifically, lignin-enzyme interactions and the effects of lignin compositional units, hydroxycinnamates, and lignin functional groups on biomass recalcitrance have been highlighted, which will be useful not only in addressing biomass recalcitrance but also in deploying renewable lignocelluloses efficiently.;,citation_author=Mi Li;,citation_author=Yunqiao Pu;,citation_author=Arthur J.

Various NA conjugations (mainly methylation and glycosylation) have been detected and have long been proposed for NA detoxification in plants. Previously, we demonstrated that NA O-glucosylation functions as a mobilizable storage form for NAD biosynthesis in the Brassicaceae. However, little is known about the functions of other NA conjugations in plants. In this study, we first found that N-methylnicotinate is a ubiquitous NA conjugation in land plants. Furthermore, we functionally identified a novel methyltransferase (At3g53140; NANMT), which is mainly responsible for N-methylnicotinate formation, from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). We also established that trigonelline is a detoxification form of endogenous NA in plants. Combined phylogenetic analysis and enzymatic assays revealed that NA N-methylation activity was likely derived from the duplication and subfunctionalization of an ancestral caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene in the course of land plant evolution. COMT enzymes, which function in S-lignin biosynthesis, also have weak NANMT activity. Our data suggest that NA detoxification conferred by NANMT and COMT might have facilitated the retention of the Preiss-Handler pathway in land plants.;,citation_author=Wei Li;,citation_author=Fengxia Zhang;,citation_author=Ranran Wu;,citation_author=Lijia Jia;,citation_author=Guosheng Li;,citation_author=Yalong Guo;,citation_author=Cuimin Liu;,citation_author=Guodong Wang;,citation_publication_date=2017;,citation_cover_date=2017;,citation_year=2017;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1104/pp.17.00259;,citation_isbn=0000000289948;,citation_issn=0032-0889;,citation_pmid=28533213;,citation_volume=174;,citation_journal_title=Plant Physiol.;">

Plant Biotechnology Journal published by Society for Experimental Biology and The Association of Applied Biologists and John Wiley &amp;amp;amp; Sons Ltd. Genetic modification of plant cell walls has been posed to reduce lignocellulose recalcitrance for enhancing biomass saccharification. Since cellulose synthase (CESA) gene was first identified, several dozen CESA mutants have been reported, but almost all mutants exhibit the defective phenotypes in plant growth and development. In this study, the rice (Oryza sativa) Osfc16 mutant with substitutions (W481C, P482S) at P-CR conserved site in CESA9 shows a slightly affected plant growth and higher biomass yield by 25%–41% compared with wild type (Nipponbare, a japonica variety). Chemical and ultrastructural analyses indicate that Osfc16 has a significantly reduced cellulose crystallinity (CrI) and thinner secondary cell walls compared with wild type. CESA co-IP detection, together with implementations of a proteasome inhibitor (MG132) and two distinct cellulose inhibitors (Calcofluor, CGA), shows that CESA9 mutation could affect integrity of CESA4/7/9 complexes, which may lead to rapid CESA proteasome degradation for low-DP cellulose biosynthesis. These may reduce cellulose CrI, which improves plant lodging resistance, a major and integrated agronomic trait on plant growth and grain production, and enhances biomass enzymatic saccharification by up to 2.3-fold and ethanol productivity by 34%–42%.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Convergent evolution of hetero-oligomeric cellulose synthesis complexes in mosses and seed plants;,citation_abstract=In seed plants, cellulose is synthesized by rosette-shaped cellulose synthesis complexes (CSCs) that are obligate hetero-oligomeric, comprising three non-interchangeable cellulose synthase (CESA) isoforms. The moss Physcomitrella patens has rosette CSCs and seven CESAs, but its common ancestor with seed plants had rosette CSCs and a single CESA gene. Therefore, if P. patens CSCs are hetero-oligomeric, then CSCs of this type evolved convergently in mosses and seed plants. Previous gene knockout and promoter swap experiments showed that PpCESAs from class A (PpCESA3 and PpCESA8) and class B (PpCESA6 and PpCESA7) have non-redundant functions in secondary cell wall cellulose deposition in leaf midribs, whereas the two members of each class are redundant. Based on these observations, we proposed the hypothesis that the secondary class A and class B PpCESAs associate to form hetero-oligomeric CSCs. Here we show that transcription of secondary class A PpCESAs is reduced when secondary class B PpCESAs are knocked out and vice versa, as expected for genes encoding isoforms that occupy distinct positions within the same CSC. The class A and class B isoforms co-accumulate in developing gametophores and co-immunoprecipitate, suggesting that they interact to form a complex in planta. Finally, secondary PpCESAs interact with each other, whereas three of four fail to self-interact when expressed in two different heterologous systems. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that obligate hetero-oligomeric CSCs evolved independently in mosses and seed plants and we propose the constructive neutral evolution hypothesis as a plausible explanation for convergent evolution of hetero-oligomeric CSCs.;,citation_author=Xingxing Li;,citation_author=Tori L.

A single-nucleotide mutation in SbBC1 led to reduced mechanical strength, decreased cellulose content, and increased lignin content without obviously altering plant morphology. Transmission electron microscopy revealed reduced cell wall thickness in sclerenchyma cells of the bc1 mutant. SbBC1 is primarily expressed in developing sclerenchyma cells and vascular bundles in sorghum. RNA-seq analysis further suggested a possible mechanism by which SbBC1 mediates cellulose biosynthesis and cell wall remodeling.

Class III peroxidases (CIII Prxs) are key proteins to the environmental adaptation of citrus plants to a range of exogenous pathogens, but the role of CIII Prxs during plant resistance to CBC is poorly defined. Herein, we explored the role of CsPrx25 and its contribution to plant defenses in molecular detail. Based on the expression analysis, CsPrx25 was identified as an apoplast-localized protein that is differentially regulated by Xcc infection, salicylic acid, and methyl jasmone acid in the CBC-susceptible variety Wanjincheng (C. sinensis) and the CBC-resistant variety Calamondin (C. madurensis). Transgenic Wanjincheng plants overexpressing CsPrx25 were generated, and these transgenic plants exhibited significantly increased CBC resistance compared with the WT plants. In addition, the CsPrx25-overexpressing plants displayed altered reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis accompanied by enhanced H2O2 levels, which led to stronger hypersensitivity responses during Xcc infection. Moreover, the overexpression of CsPrx25 enhanced lignification as an apoplastic barrier for Xcc infection. Taken together, the results highlight how CsPrx25-mediated ROS homeostasis reconstruction and cell wall lignification can enhance the resistance of sweet orange to CBC.;,citation_author=Qiang Li;,citation_author=Xiujuan Qin;,citation_author=Jingjing Qi;,citation_author=Wanfu Dou;,citation_author=Christophe Dunand;,citation_author=Shanchun Chen;,citation_author=Yongrui He;,citation_publication_date=2020-12;,citation_cover_date=2020-12;,citation_year=2020;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1038/s41438-020-00415-9;,citation_issn=2052-7276;,citation_volume=7;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Hortic.

A prominent example of this is the response to gravity, in which shoots bend up and roots bend down1. This paradox is based on opposite effects of the phytohormone auxin, which promotes cell expansion in shoots while inhibiting it in roots via a yet unknown cellular mechanism2. Here, by combining microfluidics, live imaging, genetic engineering and phosphoproteomics in Arabidopsis thaliana, we advance understanding of how auxin inhibits root growth. We show that auxin activates two distinct, antagonistically acting signalling pathways that converge on rapid regulation of apoplastic pH, a causative determinant of growth. Cell surface-based TRANSMEMBRANE KINASE1 (TMK1) interacts with and mediates phosphorylation and activation of plasma membrane H+-ATPases for apoplast acidification, while intracellular canonical auxin signalling promotes net cellular H+ influx, causing apoplast alkalinization.

Seed plants use different CESA isoforms for primary and secondary cell wall deposition. Both primary and secondary CESAs form hetero-oligomeric CSCs that assemble and function in planta only when all the required isoforms are present. The moss Physcomitrium (Physcomitrella) patens has seven CESA genes that can be grouped into two functionally and phylogenetically distinct classes. Previously, we showed that PpCESA3 and/or PpCESA8 (class A) together with PpCESA6 and/or PpCESA7 (class B) form obligate hetero-oligomeric complexes required for normal secondary cell wall deposition. Here, we show that gametophore morphogenesis requires a member of class A, PpCESA5, and is sustained in the absence of other PpCESA isoforms. PpCESA5 also differs from the other class A PpCESAs as it is able to self-interact and does not co-immunoprecipitate with other PpCESA isoforms. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that homo-oligomeric CSCs containing only PpCESA5 subunits synthesize cellulose required for gametophore morphogenesis. Analysis of mutant phenotypes also revealed that, like secondary cell wall deposition, normal protonemal tip growth requires class B isoforms (PpCESA4 or PpCESA10), along with a class A partner (PpCESA3, PpCESA5, or PpCESA8).

Two cysteine (Cys) sites, Cys562 and Cys641, which are exposed on the surface of CESA1 and CESA9 and located in the cellulose synthase catalytic domain, were identified to be S-nitrosylated. Meanwhile, Cys641 was located on the binding surface of CESA1 and CESA9, and Cys562 was very close to the binding surface. The dynamics of cellulose synthase complexes (CSCs) were closely related to cellulose content. S-nitrosylation of CESA1 and CESA9 improved the rate of mobility of the particles, and thus increased the accumulation of cellulose in Arabidopsis hypocotyl cells.

We compared root growth responses of the halophyte Schrenkiella parvula with its glycophytic relative species Arabidopsis thaliana under salt stress and performed transcriptomic analysis of S. parvula roots to identify possible gene regulatory networks underlying their physiological responses. Schrenkiella parvula roots do not avoid salt and experience less growth inhibition under salt stress. Salt-induced abscisic acid levels were higher in S. parvula roots compared with Arabidopsis. Root transcriptomic analysis of S. parvula revealed the induction of sugar transporters and genes regulating cell expansion and suberization under salt stress. 14C-labeled carbon partitioning analyses showed that S. parvula continued allocating carbon to roots from shoots under salt stress while carbon barely allocated to Arabidopsis roots. Further physiological investigation revealed that S. parvula roots maintained root cell expansion and enhanced suberization under severe salt stress.

However, their physiological functions are still not well understood. We obtained sequence information for a putative laccase gene, ZmLAC1, from maize and studied ZmLAC1 expression in detail. The deduced ZmLAC1 protein was 70% identical to LpLAC5-4, a laccase from ryegrass. ZmLAC1 was expressed in leaves, stems and roots of maize seedlings. In unstressed maize primary roots, a higher ZmLAC1 transcript level was located in the basal region where cell elongation had ceased compared to the apical 5 mm of the roots where cells were rapidly dividing and elongating. A treatment with 300 mM NaCl resulted in a shortened root elongation zone (&amp;amp;amp;lt; 2 mm) and swelling in the apical 5 mm. Associated with the morphological change, the transcript level of ZmLACl was enhanced in the apical 5 mm, reaching a level similar to that in the basal region. Other abiotic stresses tested–such as 28.5% polyethylene glycol (PEG), which caused an inhibition of root elongation comparable to 300 mM NaCl–did not affect ZmLAC1 transcript level.

KOR1 is a membrane-anchored endo-\beta1,4-glucanase and contains eight potential <i>N</i>-glycosylation sites in its extracellular domain. Here, we expressed <i>A. thaliana</i> KOR1 as a soluble, enzymatically active protein in insect cells and analyzed its <i>N</i>-glycosylation state. Structural analysis revealed that all eight potential <i>N</i>-glycosylation sites are utilized. Individual elimination of evolutionarily conserved <i>N</i>-glycosylation sites did not abolish proper KOR1 folding, but mutations of Asn-216, Asn-324, Asn-345, and Asn-567 resulted in considerably lower enzymatic activity. In contrast, production of wild-type KOR1 in the presence of the class I \alpha-mannosidase inhibitor kifunensine, which abolished the conversion of KOR1 <i>N</i>-glycans into complex structures, did not affect the activity of the enzyme. To address <i>N</i>-glycosylation site occupancy and <i>N</i>-glycan composition of KOR1 under more natural conditions, we expressed a chimeric KOR1-Fc-GFP fusion protein in leaves of <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>.

The location of its heme and calcium moieties have been shown and their role demonstrated. However, the structure and role of its glycans is only now being elucidated. The role of three N-linked complex glycans on cationic peroxidase (cPrx) of peanut (Arachis hypogaea L cv. Valencia), as expressed by prxPNC1 in transgenic tobacco, was analyzed by site-directed replacement of each of the three glycosylation sites, N-60, N-144, and N-185 with Q, individually. The mutant prxPNC1 cDNAs with a 3\prime histidine-tag were expressed in transgenic tobacco. The effect on the catalytic ability, thermal stability, and unfolding properties of the mutant peroxidases, isolated from the medium of transgenic tobacco cell suspension cultures were compared with those of the wild cPrx from peanut. It was found that the ablation of the glycans at N-60 and N-144 influences the full expression of the cPrx catalytic ability. The glycan at N-185 is important for the thermostability, as is the removal of the carbohydrate chain at N-185, resulting in rapid enzymatic decrease at temperatures of 50^\circC.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Apyrase Suppression Raises Extracellular ATP Levels and Induces Gene Expression and Cell Wall Changes Characteristic of Stress Responses;,citation_abstract=Plant cells release ATP into their extracellular matrix as they grow, and extracellular ATP (eATP) can modulate the rate of cell growth in diverse tissues. Two closely related apyrases (APYs) in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), APY1 and APY2, function, in part, to control the concentration of eATP. The expression of APY1/APY2 can be inhibited by RNA interference, and this suppression leads to an increase in the concentration of eATP in the extracellular medium and severely reduces growth. To clarify how the suppression of APY1 and APY2 is linked to growth inhibition, the gene expression changes that occur in seedlings when apyrase expression is suppressed were assayed by microarray and quantitative real-time-PCR analyses. The most significant gene expression changes induced by APY suppression were in genes involved in biotic stress responses, which include those genes regulating wall composition and extensibility. These expression changes predicted specific chemical changes in the walls of mutant seedlings, and two of these changes, wall lignification and decreased methyl ester bonds, were verified by direct analyses. Taken together, the results are consistent with the hypothesis that APY1, APY2, and eATP play important roles in the signaling steps that link biotic stresses to plant defense responses and growth changes.;,citation_author=M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Lignin composition is related to xylem embolism resistance and leaf life span in trees in a tropical semiarid climate;,citation_abstract=Wood properties influence the leaf life span (LL) of tree crowns. As lignin is an important component of wood and the water transport system, we investigated its relationship with embolism resistance and the LL of several tree species in a seasonally dry tropical ecosystem. We determined total lignin and the monomer contents of guaiacyl (G) and syringyl (S) and related them to wood traits and xylem vulnerability to embolism (\Psi50) for the most common species of the Brazilian semiarid, locally known as Caatinga. Leaf life span was negatively related to \Psi50 and positively related to S : G, which was negatively related to \Psi50. This means that greater S : G increases LL by reducing \Psi50. Lignin content was not correlated with any variable. We found two apparently unrelated axes of drought resistance. One axis, associated with lignin monomeric composition, increases LL in the dry season as a result of lower xylem embolism vulnerability. The other, associated with wood density and stem water content, helps leafless trees to withstand drought and allows them to resprout at the end of the dry season. The monomeric composition of lignin (S : G) is therefore an important functional wood attribute affecting several key functional aspects of tropical tree species in a semiarid climate.;,citation_author=Taysla R.

However, limited research has been performed on the sRNAs involved in plant wound responses. In the present study, a novel wounding-induced sRNA, sRNA8105, was identified in sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas cv. Tainung 57) using microarray analysis. It was found that expression of sRNA8105 increased after mechanical wounding. Furthermore, Dicer-like 1 (DCL1) is required for the sRNA8105 precursor (pre-sRNA8105) to generate 22 and 24 nt mature sRNA8105. sRNA8105 targeted the first intron of IbMYB1 (MYB domain protein 1) before RNA splicing, and mediated RNA cleavage and DNA methylation of IbMYB1. The interaction between sRNA8105 and IbMYB1 was confirmed by cleavage site mapping, agro-infiltration analyses, and use of a transgenic sweet potato over-expressing pre-sRNA8105 gene. Induction of IbMYB1-siRNA was observed in the wild-type upon wounding and in transgenic sweet potato over-expressing pre-sRNA8105 gene without wounding, resulting in decreased expression of the whole IbMYB1 gene family, i.e. IbMYB1 and the IbMYB2 genes, and thus directing metabolic flux toward biosynthesis of lignin in the phenylpropanoid pathway. In conclusion, sRNA8105 induced by wounding binds to the first intron of IbMYB1 RNA to methylate IbMYB1, cleave IbMYB1 RNA, and trigger production of secondary siRNAs, further repressing the expression of the IbMYB1 family genes and regulating the phenylpropanoid pathway. © 2013 John Wiley &amp;amp;amp; Sons Ltd.;,citation_author=Jeng Shane Lin;,citation_author=Chih Ching Lin;,citation_author=Yu Chi Li;,citation_author=Ming Tsung Wu;,citation_author=Mong Hsun Tsai;,citation_author=Yue Ie C Hsing;,citation_author=Shih Tong Jeng;,citation_publication_date=2013;,citation_cover_date=2013;,citation_year=2013;,citation_issue=5;,citation_doi=10.1111/tpj.12238;,citation_isbn=1365-313X (Electronic) 0960-7412 (Linking);,citation_issn=09607412;,citation_pmid=23663233;,citation_volume=75;,citation_journal_title=Plant J.;">

The Arabidopsis thaliana dgd1 mutants have a greater than 90% reduction in DGDG content, reduced photosynthesis, and altered chloroplast morphology. However, the most pronounced visible phenotype is the extremely short inflorescence stem, but how deficient DGDG biosynthesis causes this phenotype is unclear. We found that, in dgd1 mutants, phloem cap cells were lignified and jasmonic acid (JA)-responsive genes were highly upregulated under normal growth conditions. The coronative insensitive1 dgd1 and allene oxide synthase dgd1 double mutants no longer exhibited the short inflorescence stem and lignification phenotypes but still had the same lipid profile and reduced photosynthesis as dgd1 single mutants. Hormone and lipidomics analyses showed higher levels of JA, JA-isoleucine, 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid, and arabidopsides in dgd1 mutants. Transcript and protein level analyses further suggest that JA biosynthesis in dgd1 is initially activated through the increased expression of genes encoding 13-lipoxygenases (LOXs) and phospholipase A-Ig3 (At1g51440), a plastid lipase with a high substrate preference for MGDG, and is sustained by further increases in LOX and allene oxide cyclase mRNA and protein levels.

However, whether monolignol glycosylation is crucial for cell wall lignification and how it exerts effects are still unknown. Here, we report the identification of a mutant ugt72b1 showing aggravated and ectopic lignification in floral stems along with arrested growth and anthocyanin accumulation. Histochemical assays and thioacidolysis analysis confirmed the enhanced lignification and increased lignin biosynthesis in the ugt72b1 mutant. The loss of UDP-glycosyltransferase UGT72B1 function was responsible for the lignification phenotype, as demonstrated by complementation experiments. Enzyme activity analysis indicated that UGT72B1 could catalyze the glucose conjugation of monolignols, especially coniferyl alcohol and coniferyl aldehyde, which was confirmed by analyzing monolignol glucosides of UGT72B1 transgenic plants. Furthermore, the UGT72B1 gene was strongly expressed in young stem tissues, especially xylem tissues. However, UGT72B1 paralogs such as UGT72B2 and UGT72B3 had weak enzyme activity toward monolignols and weak expression in stem tissues. Transcriptomic profiling showed that UGT72B1 knockout resulted in extensively increased transcript levels of genes involved in monolignol biosynthesis, lignin polymerization and cell wall related transcription factors, which was confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR assays. These results provided evidence that monolignol glucosylation catalyzed by UGT72B1 was essential for normal cell wall lignification, thus offering insight into the molecular mechanism of cell wall development and cell wall lignification.

Downregulation of PtrHCTs reduced Ptr4CL activities in the stem-differentiating xylem (SDX) of transgenic P. trichocarpa. The Ptr4CL/PtrHCT interactions were then validated in vivo using biomolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) and protein pull-down assays in P. trichocarpa SDX extracts. Enzyme activity assays using recombinant proteins of Ptr4CL and PtrHCT showed elevated CoA ligation activity for Ptr4CL when supplemented with PtrHCT. Numerical analyses based on an evolutionary computation of the CoA ligation activity estimated the stoichiometry of the protein complex to consist of one Ptr4CL and two PtrHCTs, which was experimentally confirmed by chemical cross-linking using SDX plant protein extracts and recombinant proteins. Based on these results, we propose that Ptr4CL/PtrHCT complexes modulate the metabolic flux of CoA ligation for monolignol biosynthesis during wood formation in P. trichocarpa.;,citation_author=Chien-Yuan Lin;,citation_author=Yi Sun;,citation_author=Jina Song;,citation_author=Hsi-Chuan Chen;,citation_author=Rui Shi;,citation_author=Chenmin Yang;,citation_author=Jie Liu;,citation_author=Sermsawat Tunlaya-Anukit;,citation_author=Baoguang Liu;,citation_author=Philip L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=TMK-based cell-surface auxin signalling activates cell-wall acidification;,citation_abstract=The phytohormone auxin controls many processes in plants, at least in part through its regulation of cell expansion1. The acid growth hypothesis has been proposed to explain auxin-stimulated cell expansion for five decades, but the mechanism that underlies auxin-induced cell-wall acidification is poorly characterized. Auxin induces the phosphorylation and activation of the plasma membrane H+-ATPase that pumps protons into the apoplast2, yet how auxin activates its phosphorylation remains unclear. Here we show that the transmembrane kinase (TMK) auxin-signalling proteins interact with plasma membrane H+-ATPases, inducing their phosphorylation, and thereby promoting cell-wall acidification and hypocotyl cell elongation in Arabidopsis. Auxin induced interactions between TMKs and H+-ATPases in the plasma membrane within seconds, as well as TMK-dependent phosphorylation of the penultimate threonine residue&nbsp;on the&nbsp;H+-ATPases. Our genetic, biochemical and molecular evidence demonstrates that TMKs directly phosphorylate plasma membrane H+-ATPase and are required for auxin-induced H+-ATPase activation, apoplastic acidification and cell expansion.

However, the proteases responsible for D1 protein degradation remain unknown. In this study, we investigate the possible role of the FtsH protease, an ATP-dependent zinc metalloprotease, during this process. The primary light-induced cleavage product of the D1 protein, a 23-kD fragment, was found to be degraded in isolated thylakoids in the dark during a process dependent on ATP hydrolysis and divalent metal ions, suggesting the involvement of FtsH. Purified FtsH degraded the 23-kD D1 fragment present in isolated photosystem II core complexes, as well as that in thylakoid membranes depleted of endogenous FtsH. In this study, we definitively identify the chloro- plast protease acting on the D1 protein during its light-induced turnover.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Evidence for the involvement of cell wall peroxidase in the generation of hydroxyl radicals mediating extension growth;,citation_abstract=Hydroxyl radicals (\cdotOH), produced in the cell wall, are capable of cleaving wall polymers and can thus mediate cell wall loosening and extension growth. It has recently been proposed that the biochemical mechanism responsible for \cdotOH generation in the cell walls of growing plant organs represents an enzymatic reaction catalyzed by apoplastic peroxidase (POD). This hypothesis was investigated by supplying cell walls of maize (Zea mays L.) coleoptiles and sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) hypocotyls with external NADH, an artificial substrate known to cause \cdotOH generation by POD in vitro. The effects of NADH on wall loosening, growth, and \cdotOH production in vivo were determined. NADH mediates cell wall extension in vitro and in vivo in an H2O2-dependent reaction that shows the characteristic features of POD. NADH-mediated production of \cdotOH in vivo was demonstrated in maize coleoptiles using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy in combination with a specific spin-trapping reaction. Kinetic properties and inhibitor/activator sensitivities of the \cdotOH-producing reaction in the cell walls of coleoptiles resembled the properties of horseradish POD. Apoplastic consumption of external NADH by living coleoptiles can be traced back to the superimposed action of two enzymatic reactions, a KCN-sensitive reaction mediated by POD operating in the \cdotOH-forming mode, and a KCN-insensitive reaction with the kinetic properties of a superoxide-producing plasma-membrane NADH oxidase the activity of which can be promoted by auxin. Under natural conditions, i.e. in the absence of external NADH, this enzyme may provide superoxide (O2\cdot-) (and H2O2 utilized by POD for) \cdotOH production in the cell wall.;,citation_author=Anja Liszkay;,citation_author=Barbara Kenk;,citation_author=Peter Schopfer;,citation_publication_date=2003-08;,citation_cover_date=2003-08;,citation_year=2003;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1007/s00425-003-1028-1;,citation_issn=1432-2048;,citation_volume=217;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Planta;">

Here, we analyzed 29 sequenced genomes and 17 transcriptomes to revise the phylogeny of the CesA gene superfamily in angiosperms. Our results identify ancestral gene clusters that predate the monocot-eudicot divergence and reveal several novel evolutionary observations, including the expansion of the Poaceae-specific cellulose synthase-like CslF family to the graminids and restiids and the characterization of a previously unreported eudicot lineage, CslM, that forms a reciprocally monophyletic eudicot-monocot grouping with the CslJ clade. The CslM lineage is widely distributed in eudicots, and the CslJ clade, which was thought previously to be restricted to the Poales, is widely distributed in monocots.

The pattern of color development found when stem sections were stained in the presence and absence of H2O2 suggested that p-diphenol:O2 oxidoreductase activity was tightly correlated spatially and temporally with the lignification of secondary cell walls in developing primary xylem. The correlation between this laccase-like phenoloxidase activity and lignification appeared tighter than that between lignification and peroxidases stained using the same substrates. Zymogram analysis of the phenoloxidase activities catalyzed by enzymes that were not boiled prior to separation by SDS—PAGE suggested that a single enzyme was predominantly responsible for the laccase-like phenoloxidase activity in Zinnia stems. Some of this enzyme was released from cell wall residue by washing with high ionic strength buffer; however, substantial amounts of the enzyme could only be recovered after treatment of the residue with cell wall-degrading enzymes.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Sequestration and transport of lignin monomeric precursors;,citation_abstract=Lignin is the second most abundant terrestrial biopolymer after cellulose.

Thereafter, these monomeric precursors are exported into the cell wall, where they are polymerized and integrated into the wall matrix. Accordingly, transport of monolignols across cell membranes is a critical step affecting deposition of lignin in the secondarily thickened cell wall. While the biosynthesis of monolignols is relatively well understood, our knowledge of sequestration and transport of these monomers is sketchy. In this article, we review different hypotheses on monolignol transport and summarize the recent progresses toward the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying monolignol sequestration and transport across membranes.

Cellulose chains pack laterally into crystalline forms, stacking into a complicated crystallographic structure. However, the mechanism of cellulose crystallization is poorly understood. Here, via functional characterization, we report that Brittle Culm1 (BC1), a COBRA-like protein in rice, modifies cellulose crystallinity. BC1 was demonstrated to be a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchored protein and can be released into cell walls by removal of the GPI anchor. BC1 possesses a carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) at its N-terminus. In vitro binding assays showed that this CBM interacts specifically with crystalline cellulose, and several aromatic residues in this domain are essential for binding. It was further demonstrated that cell wall-localized BC1 via the CBM and GPI anchor is one functional form of BC1. X-ray diffraction (XRD) assays revealed that mutations in BC1 and knockdown of BC1 expression decrease the crystallite width of cellulose; overexpression of BC1 and the CBM-mutated BC1s caused varied crystallinity with results that were consistent with the in vitro binding assay. Moreover, interaction between the CBM and cellulose microfibrils was largely repressed when the cell wall residues were pre-stained with two cellulose dyes. Treating wild-type and bc1 seedlings with the dyes resulted in insensitive root growth responses in bc1 plants. Combined with the evidence that BC1 and three secondary wall cellulose synthases (CESAs) function in different steps of cellulose production as revealed by genetic analysis, we conclude that BC1 modulates cellulose assembly by interacting with cellulose and affecting microfibril crystallinity.;,citation_author=Lifeng Liu;,citation_author=Keke Shang-Guan;,citation_author=Baocai Zhang;,citation_author=Xiangling Liu;,citation_author=Meixian Yan;,citation_author=Lanjun Zhang;,citation_author=Yanyun Shi;,citation_author=Mu Zhang;,citation_author=Qian Qian;,citation_author=Jiayang Li;,citation_author=Yihua Zhou;,citation_publication_date=2013-08;,citation_cover_date=2013-08;,citation_year=2013;,citation_issue=8;,citation_doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1003704;,citation_issn=1553-7404;,citation_volume=9;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=PLOS Genet.;,citation_publisher=Public Library of Science;">

Here, we report that BLH6, a BELL1-LIKE HOMEODOMAIN protein, specifically interacts with KNAT7, and this interaction influences secondary cell wall development. BLH6 is a transcriptional repressor, and BLH6-KNAT7 physical interaction enhances KNAT7 and BLH6 repression activities. The overlapping expression patterns of BLH6 and KNAT7 and phenotypes of blh6, knat7, and blh6 knat7 loss-of-function mutants are consistent with the existence of a BLH6-KNAT7 heterodimer that represses commitment to secondary cell wall biosynthesis in interfascicular fibers. BLH6 and KNAT7 overexpression results in thinner interfascicular fiber secondary cell walls, phenotypes that are dependent on the interacting partner. A major impact of the loss of BLH6 and KNAT7 function is enhanced expression of the homeodomain-leucine zipper transcription factor REVOLUTA/INTERFASCICULAR FIBERLESS1 (REV/IFL1).

Functional disruption of the CMUs caused lateral microtubule displacement and compromised microtubule-based guidance of CSC movement. CSCs that traversed the microtubules interacted with the microtubules via CSI1/POM2, which prompted the lateral microtubule displacement. Hence, we have revealed how microtubules can withstand the propulsion of the CSCs during cellulose biosynthesis and thus sustain anisotropic plant cell growth.;,citation_author=Zengyu Liu;,citation_author=Rene Schneider;,citation_author=Christopher Kesten;,citation_author=Yi Zhang;,citation_author=Marc Somssich;,citation_author=Youjun Zhang;,citation_author=Alisdair R.

Here we developed a proximity-based tagging system, PUP-IT (pupylation-based interaction tagging), to identify membrane protein interactions. In this approach, a small protein tag, Pup, is applied to proteins that interact with a PafA-fused bait, enabling transient and weak interactions to be enriched and detected by mass spectrometry. Pup does not diffuse from the enzyme, which allows high-specificity labeling. We applied this approach to CD28, a critical costimulatory receptor for T lymphocyte activation, and identified known CD28 binding partners and multiple potential interacting proteins. In addition, we demonstrated that this method can identify the interaction between a cell surface receptor and its ligand.;,citation_author=Qiang Liu;,citation_author=Jun Zheng;,citation_author=Weiping Sun;,citation_author=Yinbo Huo;,citation_author=Liye Zhang;,citation_author=Piliang Hao;,citation_author=Haopeng Wang;,citation_author=Min Zhuang;,citation_publication_date=2018-09;,citation_cover_date=2018-09;,citation_year=2018;,citation_issue=9;,citation_doi=10.1038/s41592-018-0100-5;,citation_issn=1548-7105;,citation_volume=15;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Nat.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Proper imputation of missing values in proteomics datasets for differential expression analysis;,citation_abstract=Abstract Label-free shotgun proteomics is an important tool in biomedical research, where tandem mass spectrometry with data-dependent acquisition (DDA) is frequently used for protein identification and quantification. However, the DDA datasets contain a significant number of missing values (MVs) that severely hinders proper analysis. Existing literature suggests that different imputation methods should be used for the two types of MVs: missing completely at random or missing not at random. However, the simulated or biased datasets utilized by most of such studies offer few clues about the composition and thus proper imputation of MVs in real-life proteomic datasets. Moreover, the impact of imputation methods on downstream differential expression analysis—a critical goal for many biomedical projects—is largely undetermined. In this study, we investigated public DDA datasets of various tissue/sample types to determine the composition of MVs in them. We then developed simulated datasets that imitate the MV profile of real-life datasets. Using such datasets, we compared the impact of various popular imputation methods on the analysis of differentially expressed proteins. Finally, we make recommendations on which imputation method(s) to use for proteomic data beyond just DDA datasets.;,citation_author=Mingyi Liu;,citation_author=Ashok Dongre;,citation_publication_date=2021-05;,citation_cover_date=2021-05;,citation_year=2021;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1093/bib/bbaa112;,citation_issn=1467-5463, 1477-4054;,citation_volume=22;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Brief.

A preliminary list published nine years ago in Plant Physiology is outdated, and genome-wide phenotype information remains difficult to obtain. We describe here a comprehensive dataset of 2,400 genes with a loss-of-function mutant phenotype in Arabidopsis. Phenotype descriptions were gathered primarily from manual curation of the scientific literature. Genes were placed into prioritized groups (essential, morphological, cellular-biochemical, and conditional) based on the documented phenotypes of putative knockout alleles. Phenotype classes (e.g. vegetative, reproductive, and timing, for the morphological group) and subsets (e.g. flowering time, senescence, circadian rhythms, and miscellaneous, for the timing class) were also established. Gene identities were classified as confirmed (through molecular complementation or multiple alleles) or not confirmed. Relationships between mutant phenotype and protein function, genetic redundancy, protein connectivity, and subcellular protein localization were explored. A complementary dataset of 401 genes that exhibit a mutant phenotype only when disrupted in combination with a putative paralog was also compiled. The importance of these genes in confirming functional redundancy and enhancing the value of single gene datasets is discussed. With further input and curation from the Arabidopsis community, these datasets should help to address a variety of important biological questions, provide a foundation for exploring the relationship between genotype and phenotype in angiosperms, enhance the utility of Arabidopsis as a reference plant, and facilitate comparative studies with model genetic organisms.;,citation_author=Johnny Lloyd;,citation_author=David Meinke;,citation_publication_date=2012-03;,citation_cover_date=2012-03;,citation_year=2012;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1104/pp.111.192393;,citation_issn=0032-0889;,citation_volume=158;,citation_journal_title=Plant Physiol.;">

Leucine aminopeptidases (LAPs) are predominantly studied in solanaceous plants and are induced in response to wounding, herbivory and methyl jasmonate (MeJA). The functions of plant aminopeptidases are still under discussion and it is likely that the different classes play various roles. In the present study we report the local and systemic induction of LAP-like activity upon mechanical wounding and MeJA treatment. Two proteins with LAP-like activity were detected in pigeonpea leaves. They were designated as AP1 and AP2. AP1 activity was significantly induced upon wounding and application of MeJA. The estimated molecular masses of AP1 and AP2 were ???60 and 41 kDa respectively in SDS-PAGE. The pH optimum for LAP-like activity in control leaf extracts was found to be neutral (pH 7.0) however the enzymes showed highest activity at alkaline pH (pH 9.0) in the leaf extracts of treated plants. The temperature optimum for LAP-like activity was around 40-50 ??C. The enzymes were strongly inhibited by 1, 10 phenanthroline and bestatin. Heavy metal ions and EDTA inhibited LAP-like activities, whereas Mn +2 and Mg +2 activated the enzyme activities. Beside LpNA (33.5 U/mg/min) pigeonpea LAP-like enzymes also cleaved ApNA (15 U/mg/min) but were unable to cleave VpNA. Total proteolytic activity was also observed to be induced in treated plants.

Genetic evidence in support of this hypothesis has been elusive due to functional redundancy of laccase genes. An Arabidopsis double mutant demonstrated the involvement of laccases in lignin biosynthesis. We previously identified a subset of laccase genes to be targets of a microRNA (miRNA) ptr-miR397a in Populus trichocarpa. To elucidate the roles of ptr-miR397a and its targets, we characterized the laccase gene family and identified 49 laccase gene models, of which 29 were predicted to be targets of ptr-miR397a. We overexpressed Ptr-MIR397a in transgenic P. trichocarpa. In each of all nine transgenic lines tested, 17 PtrLACs were down-regulated as analyzed by RNA-seq. Transgenic lines with severe reduction in the expression of these laccase genes resulted in an \sim40% decrease in the total laccase activity. Overexpression of Ptr-MIR397a in these transgenic lines also reduced lignin content, whereas levels of all monolignol biosynthetic gene transcripts remained unchanged. A hierarchical genetic regulatory network (GRN) built by a bottom-up graphic Gaussian model algorithm provides additional support for a role of ptr-miR397a as a negative regulator of laccases for lignin biosynthesis. Full transcriptome-based differential gene expression in the overexpressed transgenics and protein domain analyses implicate previously unidentified transcription factors and their targets in an extended hierarchical GRN including ptr-miR397a and laccases that coregulate lignin biosynthesis in wood formation. Ptr-miR397a, laccases, and other regulatory components of this network may provide additional strategies for genetic manipulation of lignin content.;,citation_author=S. Lu;,citation_author=Q.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Contribution of both lignin content and sinapyl monomer to disease resistance in tobacco;,citation_abstract=As a major component of the cell wall, lignin has been suggested to play an important role in the plant defence response to various pathogens. However, how lignin is involved in plant pathogen interaction is still unclear. Here, a series of transgenic tobacco lines were cultivated with a range of differences in lignin content and composition. Evaluation of pathogen resistance in these plants indicated that lower total lignin content aggravated the severity of tobacco black shank and bacterial wilt diseases, while increased sinapyl lignin (S) alleviated the disease symptoms. The regression analysis indicated both lignin content and S lignin were positively correlated with disease resistance. These two factors had additive effects, exhibiting stronger correlation with disease resistance when they were combined. Neither guaiacyl lignin (G) nor S/G ratio showed close correlation with disease resistance. The expression of pathogenesis-related protein genes PR2 and PR3 was induced after pathogen inoculation. However, the up-regulation of PR2 and PR3 was not associated with a disease resistance-induced increase in lignin content. These data collectively suggest that both total lignin content and S lignin are main factors that contribute to the basic defence response in tobacco.;,citation_author=Q.-H. Ma;,citation_author=H.-H.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Endoreplication mediates cell size control via mechanochemical signaling from cell wall;,citation_abstract=Endoreplication is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for increasing nuclear DNA content (ploidy). Ploidy frequently scales with final cell and organ size, suggesting a key role for endoreplication in these processes. However, exceptions exist, and, consequently, the endoreplication-size nexus remains enigmatic. Here, we show that prolonged tissue folding at the apical hook in Arabidopsis requires endoreplication asymmetry under the control of an auxin gradient. We identify a molecular pathway linking endoreplication levels to cell size through cell wall remodeling and stiffness modulation. We find that endoreplication is not only permissive for growth: Endoreplication reduction enhances wall stiffening, actively reducing cell size. The cell wall integrity kinase THESEUS plays a key role in this feedback loop. Our data thus explain the nonlinearity between ploidy levels and size while also providing a molecular mechanism linking mechanochemical signaling with endoreplication-mediated dynamic control of cell growth.;,citation_author=Yuan Ma;,citation_author=Kristoffer Jonsson;,citation_author=Bibek Aryal;,citation_author=Lieven De Veylder;,citation_author=Olivier Hamant;,citation_author=Rishikesh P.

We provide evidence that Arabidopsis SCW-specific Fasciclin-Like Arabinogalactan-proteins 11 (FLA11) and 12 (FLA12) are possible cell surface sensors regulating SCW development in response to mechanical stimuli. Plants overexpressing FLA11 (OE-FLA11) showed earlier SCW development compared to the wild-type (WT) and altered SCW properties that phenocopy WT plants under compression stress. By contrast, OE-FLA12 stems showed higher cellulose content compared to WT plants, similar to plants experiencing tensile stress. fla11, OE-FLA11, fla12, and OE-FLA12 plants showed altered SCW responses to mechanical stress compared to the WT. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and RNA-seq analysis revealed the up-regulation of genes and pathways involved in stress responses and SCW synthesis and regulation. Analysis of OE-FLA11 nst1 nst3 plants suggests that FLA11 regulation of SCWs is reliant on classical transcriptional networks.

In contrast to this arrangement, the genome of Streptomyces coelicolor was found to encode a small, four-copper oxidase that lacks the second domain. This protein is representative of a new family of enzymes-the two-domain laccases. Disruption of the corresponding gene abrogates laccase activity in the growth media. We have recombinantly expressed this enzyme, called SLAC, in Escherichia coli and characterized it. The enzyme binds four copper ions/monomer, and UV-visible absorption and EPR measurements confirm that the conserved type 1 copper site and trinuclear cluster are intact. We also report the first known paramagnetic NMR spectrum for the trinuclear copper cluster of a protein from the laccase family. The enzyme is highly stable, retaining activity as a dimer in denaturing gels after boiling and SDS treatment. The activity of the enzyme against 2,6-dimethoxyphenol (DMP) peaks at an unprecedentedly high pH (9.4), whereas the activity against ferrocyanide decreases with pH.

The products of CAD, cinnamyl alcohols, are the precursors of lignin, a major cell wall polymer of plant vascular tissues. Lignin composition in this mutant shows dramatic modifications, including increased incorporation of the substrate of CAD (coniferaldehyde), indicating that CAD may modulate lignin composition in pine. The recessive cad-n1 allele, which causes this phenotype, was discovered in a tree heterozygous for this mutant allele. It is inherited as a simple Mendelian locus that maps to the same genomic region as the cad locus. In mutant plants, CAD activity and abundance of cad RNA transcript are low, and free CAD substrate accumulates to a high level. The wood of the mutant is brown, whereas the wood in wild types is nearly white. The wood phenotype resembles that of brown midrib (bm) mutants and some transgenic plants in which xylem is red-brown due to a reduction in CAD activity. However, unlike transgenics with reduced CAD, the pine mutant has decreased lignin content.

T1 and T2/T3 copper binding sites and three N-glycosylated sites at Asn75, Asn238, and Asn458 were elucidated. Initial rate kinetic analysis revealed that the kcat, Km, and kcat/Km of nLcc4 with substrate ABTS were 3,382 s-1, 65.0 +/- 6.5 muM, and 52 s-1muM-1, respectively; and the values with lignosulfonic acid determined using isothermal titration calorimetry were 0.234 s-1, 56.7 +/- 3.2 muM, and 0.004 s-1muM-1, respectively. Endo H-deglycosylated nLcc4 (dLcc4), with only one GlcNAc residue remaining at each of the three N-glycosylation sites in the enzyme, exhibited similar kinetic efficiency and thermal stability to that of nLcc4. The isolated Lcc4 gene contains an open reading frame of 1563 bp with a deduced polypeptide of 521 amino acid residues including a predicted signaling peptide of 21 residues at the N-terminus. Recombinant wild-type Lcc4 and mutant enzymes N75D, N238D and N458D were expressed in Pichia pastoris cells to evaluate the effect on enzyme activity by single glycosylation site deficiency. The mutant enzymes secreted in the cultural media of P. pastoris cells were observed to maintain only 4-50% of the activity of the wild-type laccase. Molecular dynamics simulations analyses of various states of (de-)glycosylation in nLcc support the kinetic results and suggest that the local H-bond networks between the domain connecting loop D2-D3 and the glycan moieties play a crucial role in the laccase activity.

The flaxseed fibers were further separated and treated with laccase to conjugate the model compounds, that is, the hydrophobic gallate molecules on fiber surfaces. Laccase was able to slowly oxidize fiber-conjugated phenolics, but no fundamental changes in fiber cell surface structure or notable coupling of the applied hydrophobic gallate molecules onto the fibers occurred, as revealed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The reactivity of the mature fibers was further investigated using cellulolytic enzymes. Cellobiohydrolase (CBH) and endoglucanase (EG)-rich enzyme preparations were applied to reach a hydrolysis degree of 1–6% (of the fiber dry matter) using a standard enzyme dosage. The CBH mixture altered the fiber surface morphology distinctly, and SEM images illustrated fibers in which the cellulose fibrils seemed to be loosened and partially hydrolyzed. In contrast, the effect of the EG-rich preparation without CBH activity was notable on the fiber surface, polishing the surfaces. The cellulolytic treatments were potentially interesting for specific enzymatic modifications of flax fiber surfaces, whereas the approach to use oxidoreductive enzyme treatments on mature linseed fibers offered little potential, obviously due to the low lignin content of the fibers.;,citation_author=Pekka Maijala;,citation_author=Marliina Mäkinen;,citation_author=Sari Galkin;,citation_author=Kurt Fagerstedt;,citation_author=Tiina Härkäsalmi;,citation_author=Liisa Viikari;,citation_publication_date=2012-11;,citation_cover_date=2012-11;,citation_year=2012;,citation_issue=44;,citation_doi=10.1021/jf303965k;,citation_issn=0021-8561;,citation_volume=60;,citation_journal_title=J.

Using computational modeling, we show that the simplest scenario to explain pavement cell shapes within an epidermis under tension must involve mechanical wall heterogeneities across and along the anticlinal pavement cell walls between adjacent cells.

To investigate the involvement of the small Streptomyces laccases in lignin degradation, we generated acid-precipitable polymeric lignin obtained in the presence of wild-type Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) (SCWT) and its laccase-less mutant (SC\DeltaLAC) in the presence of Miscanthus x giganteus lignocellulose. The results showed that strain SC\DeltaLAC was inefficient in degrading lignin compared to strain SCWT, thereby supporting the importance of laccase for lignin degradation by S. coelicolor A3(2). We also studied the lignin degradation activity of laccases from S. coelicolor A3(2), Streptomyces lividans TK24, Streptomyces viridosporus T7A, and Amycolatopsis sp. 75iv2 using both lignin model compounds and ethanosolv lignin. All four laccases degraded a phenolic model compound (LM-OH) but were able to oxidize a nonphenolic model compound only in the presence of redox mediators. Their activities are highest at pH 8.0 with a low krel/Kapp for LM-OH, suggesting that the enzymes’ natural substrates must be different in shape or chemical nature. Crystal structures of the laccases from S. viridosporus T7A (SVLAC) and Amycolatopsis sp. 75iv2 were determined both with and without bound substrate. This is the first report of a crystal structure for any laccase bound to a nonphenolic \beta-O-4 lignin model compound. An additional zinc metal binding site in SVLAC was also identified.

On sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-PAGE, however, it displayed three major bands and several additional minor bands ranging in size from 60 kDa to 180 kDa, suggesting it being a complex of six to eight different proteins. The molecular mass of this complex was estimated to be approximately 660 kDa from the elution position of gel filtration.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Mechanism of farnesylated CAAX protein processing by the intramembrane protease Rce1.;,citation_abstract=CAAX proteins have essential roles in multiple signalling pathways, controlling processes such as proliferation, differentiation and carcinogenesis. The \sim120 mammalian CAAX proteins function at cellular membranes and include the Ras superfamily of small GTPases, nuclear lamins, the \gamma-subunit of heterotrimeric GTPases, and several protein kinases and phosphatases. The proper localization of CAAX proteins to cell membranes is orchestrated by a series of post-translational modifications of the carboxy-terminal CAAX motifs (where C is cysteine, A is an aliphatic amino acid and X is any amino acid). These reactions involve prenylation of the cysteine residue, cleavage at the AAX tripeptide and methylation of the carboxyl-prenylated cysteine residue. The major CAAX protease activity is mediated by Rce1 (Ras and a-factor converting enzyme 1), an intramembrane protease (IMP) of the endoplasmic reticulum. Information on the architecture and proteolytic mechanism of Rce1 has been lacking. Here we report the crystal structure of a Methanococcus maripaludis homologue of Rce1, whose endopeptidase specificity for farnesylated peptides mimics that of eukaryotic Rce1. Its structure, comprising eight transmembrane \alpha-helices, and catalytic site are distinct from those of other IMPs. The catalytic residues are located \sim10 Å into the membrane and are exposed to the cytoplasm and membrane through a conical cavity that accommodates the prenylated CAAX substrate. We propose that the farnesyl lipid binds to a site at the opening of two transmembrane \alpha-helices, which results in the scissile bond being positioned adjacent to a glutamate-activated nucleophilic water molecule.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Regulation and Function of a Polarly Localized Lignin Barrier in the Exodermis;,citation_abstract=Multicellular organisms control interactions with their environment through the development of specialized barriers in specific cell types. A conserved barrier in plant roots is the endodermal Casparian strip (CS). The CS is made of polymerized lignin and forms a ring-like structure that seals the apoplastic space between the endodermal cells. Most angiosperms also have another root cell type, the exodermis, that is reported to form a barrier. Our understanding of exodermal developmental and molecular regulation, as well as function, is limited as this cell type is absent from the model species Arabidopsis thaliana. Using tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) as a model system we demonstrate that in this species, the exodermis does not form a CS. Instead, it forms a polar lignin cap with an equivalent barrier function to the endodermal CS. We demonstrate that although endodermal regulators are conserved between Arabidopsis and tomato, exodermal differentiation occurs by a distinct regulatory pathway involving the SlSCZ and SlEXO1 transcription factors. Although the exodermis and endodermis both produce barriers that restrict mineral ion uptake, they have unique and overlapping roles in their selectivity. Whether conservation and similarities between the endodermis and exodermis exist in other species remains to be determined. Nonetheless, in tomato, these distinct lignin structures have a convergent function with different genetic regulations.;,citation_author=Concepcion Manzano;,citation_author=Kevin W.

The lignin isolated from the F5H-deficient fah1-2 mutant contained only traces of syringyl units and consequently enhanced phenylcoumaran and dibenzodioxocin levels. In fah1-2 transgenics in which the F5H gene was overexpressed under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter, a guaiacyl-rich, syringyl/guaiacyl lignin similar to the wild type was produced. In contrast, the isolated lignin from the fah1-2 transgenics in which F5H expression was driven by the cinnamate 4-hydroxylase promoter was almost entirely syringyl in nature. This simple lignin contained predominantly beta-aryl ether units, mainly with erythro-stereochemistry, with some resinol structures.

(maize), contain relatively high levels of p-coumarates (pCA) within their cell walls. Incorporation of pCA into cell walls is believed to be due to a hydroxycinnamyl transferase that couples pCA to monolignols. To understand the role of pCA in maize development, the p-coumaroyl CoA:hydroxycinnamyl alcohol transferase (pCAT) was isolated and purified from maize stems. Purified pCAT was subjected to partial trypsin digestion, and peptides were sequenced by tandem mass spectrometry. TBLASTN analysis of the acquired peptide sequences identified a single full-length maize cDNA clone encoding all the peptide sequences obtained from the purified enzyme. The cDNA clone was obtained and used to generate an RNAi construct for suppressing pCAT expression in maize. Here we describe the effects of suppression of pCAT in maize. Primary screening of transgenic maize seedling leaves using a new rapid analytical platform was used to identify plants with decreased amounts of pCA. Using this screening method, mature leaves from fully developed plants were analyzed, confirming reduced pCA levels throughout plant development. Complete analysis of isolated cell walls from mature transgenic stems and leaves revealed that lignin levels did not change, but pCA levels decreased and the lignin composition was altered. Transgenic plants with the lowest levels of pCA had decreased levels of syringyl units in the lignin. Thus, altering the levels of pCAT expression in maize leads to altered lignin composition, but does not appear to alter the total amount of lignin present in the cell walls.;,citation_author=Jane M.

One approach to lowering these costs is to produce crops with cell walls that are more susceptible to hydrolysis to reduce preprocessing and enzyme inputs. To deepen our understanding of the molecular genetic basis of lignocellulose recalcitrance, we have screened a mutagenized population of the model grass Brachypodium distachyon for improved saccharification with an industrial polysaccharide-degrading enzyme mixture. From an initial screen of 2,400 M2 plants, we selected 12 lines that showed heritable improvements in saccharification, mostly with no significant reduction in plant size or stem strength. Characterization of these putative mutants revealed a variety of alterations in cell-wall components. We have mapped the underlying genetic lesions responsible for increased saccharification using a deep sequencing approach, and here we report the mapping of one of the causal mutations to a narrow region in chromosome 2. The most likely candidate gene in this region encodes a GT61 glycosyltransferase, which has been implicated in arabinoxylan substitution.

Large amounts of sugar are present in the woody, nonfood parts of crops and could be used for fuel production without compromising global food security.

We developed an ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-TOF-MS)-based metabolomics approach to evaluate local and systemic herbivore-induced changes in maize leaves, sap, roots and root exudates without any prior assumptions about their function. Thirty-two differentially regulated compounds were identified from Spodoptera littoralis-infested maize seedlings and isolated for structure assignment by microflow nuclear magnetic resonance (CapNMR). Nine compounds were quantified by a high throughput direct nano-infusion tandem mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (MS/MS) method. Leaf infestation led to a marked local increase of 1,3-benzoxazin-4-ones, phospholipids, N-hydroxycinnamoyltyramines, azealic acid and tryptophan. Only few changes were found in the root metabolome, but 1,3-benzoxazin-4-ones increased in the vascular sap and root exudates. The role of N-hydroxycinnamoyltyramines in plant–herbivore interactions is unknown, and we therefore tested the effect of the dominating p-coumaroyltyramine on S.&nbsp;littoralis. Unexpectedly, p-coumaroyltyramine was metabolized by the larvae and increased larval growth, possibly by providing additional nitrogen to the insect.

We report here a previously unreported phenomenon: the existence of an absolute limit by which stomata closure must occur to avoid rapid death in drought conditions. The water potential causing stomatal closure and the xylem pressure at the onset of embolism formation were equal for only a small number of species, and the difference between these two traits (i.e. safety margins) increased continuously with increasing embolism resistance.

The high nutritional value of J. regia nuts is associated with a rich array of polyphenolic compounds, whose complete biosynthetic pathways are still unknown. A J. regia genome sequence was obtained from the cultivar Chandler to discover target genes and additional unknown genes. The 667 Mbp genome was assembled using two different methods (SOAPdenovo2 and MaSuRCA), with a N50 scaffold size of 464,955 bp (based on a 606 Mbp genome size), 221,640 contigs and 37% GC content. Annotation with MAKER-P and other genomic resources yielded 32,498 gene models. Previous studies in walnut relying on tissue-specific methods have only identified a single PPO gene (JrPPO1). Enabled by the J. regia genome sequence, a second homolog of PPO (JrPPO2) was discovered. In addition, ~130 genes in the large GGT superfamily were detected. Specifically, two genes, JrGGT1 and JrGGT2, were significantly homologous to the GGT from Quercus robur (QrGGT), which is involved in the synthesis of 1-O-galloyl-\beta-D-glucose, a precursor for the synthesis of hydrolysable tannins. The reference genome for J. regia provides meaningful insight into the complex pathways required for the synthesis of polyphenols.

Hydraulic properties have usually been studied as a function of the anatomy of xylem conduits and their pits, but recent studies have proposed that system-level properties, related to the topology of the xylem network, may also play a role. Here we study how the spatial arrangement of conduits in xylem cross sections affects the relationship between mean conduit lumen area and conduit density (packing function) across species. \bullet Methods: Point pattern analysis was used to describe the spatial distribution of xylem conduits in 97 woody species. The effect of conduit aggregation on the packing function was tested using phylogenetic generalized least squares. A hydraulic model with an explicit description of the topology of the xylem network was used to interpret the functional significance of our findings. \bullet Key results: The spatial arrangement of conduits affected the packing function across species, so that species with aggregated distributions tended to have lower conduit densities for a given conduit size and lower conduit lumen fractions. According to our modeling results, the higher conduit-to-conduit connectivity of species with aggregated distributions allows them to achieve higher hydraulic conductivity. Species with aggregated conduits, however, pay a cost in terms of increased vulnerability to embolism. \bullet Conclusions: The spatial arrangement of conduits affects the fundamental structural and functional attributes of the xylem.;,citation_author=Jordi Martínez-Vilalta;,citation_author=Maurizio Mencuccini;,citation_author=Xavier Álvarez;,citation_author=Juan Camacho;,citation_author=Lasse Loepfe;,citation_author=Josep Piñol;,citation_publication_date=2012;,citation_cover_date=2012;,citation_year=2012;,citation_issue=7;,citation_doi=10.3732/ajb.1100384;,citation_issn=1537-2197;,citation_volume=99;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Am.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Cell wall constrains lateral diffusion of plant plasma-membrane proteins;,citation_abstract=A cell membrane can be considered a liquid-phase plane in which lipids and proteins theoretically are free to diffuse. Numerous reports, however, describe retarded diffusion of membrane proteins in animal cells. This anomalous diffusion results from a combination of structuring factors including protein–protein interactions, cytoskeleton corralling, and lipid organization into microdomains. In plant cells, plasma-membrane (PM) proteins have been described as relatively immobile, but the control mechanisms that structure the PM have not been studied. Here, we use fluorescence recovery after photobleaching to estimate mobility of a set of minimal PM proteins. These proteins consist only of a PM-anchoring domain fused to a fluorescent protein, but their mobilities remained limited, as is the case for many full-length proteins. Neither the cytoskeleton nor membrane microdomain structure was involved in constraining the diffusion of these proteins. The cell wall, however, was shown to have a crucial role in immobilizing PM proteins. In addition, by single-molecule fluorescence imaging we confirmed that the pattern of cellulose deposition in the cell wall affects the trajectory and speed of PM protein diffusion. Regulation of PM protein dynamics by the plant cell wall can be interpreted as a mechanism for regulating protein interactions in processes such as trafficking and signal transduction.;,citation_author=Alexandre Martinière;,citation_author=Irene Lavagi;,citation_author=Gayathri Nageswaran;,citation_author=Daniel J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Uncovering pH at both sides of the root plasma membrane interface using noninvasive imaging;,citation_abstract=Building a proton gradient across a biological membrane and between different tissues is a matter of great importance for plant development and nutrition. To gain a better understanding of proton distribution in the plant root apoplast as well as across the plasma membrane, we generated Arabidopsis plants expressing stable membrane-anchored ratiometric fluorescent sensors based on pHluorin. These sensors enabled noninvasive pH-specific measurements in mature root cells from the medium–epidermis interface up to the inner cell layers that lie beyond the Casparian strip. The membrane-associated apoplastic pH was much more alkaline than the overall apoplastic space pH. Proton concentration associated with the plasma membrane was very stable, even when the growth medium pH was altered. This is in apparent contradiction with the direct connection between root intercellular space and the external medium. The plasma membrane-associated pH in the stele was the most preserved and displayed the lowest apoplastic pH (6.0 to 6.1) and the highest transmembrane delta pH (1.5 to 2.2). Both pH values also correlated well with optimal activities of channels and transporters involved in ion uptake and redistribution from the root to the aerial part. In growth medium where ionic content is minimized, the root plasma membrane-associated pH was more affected by environmental proton changes, especially for the most external cell layers. Calcium concentration appears to play a major role in apoplastic pH under these restrictive conditions, supporting a role for the cell wall in pH homeostasis of the unstirred surface layer of plasma membrane in mature roots.;,citation_author=Alexandre Martinière;,citation_author=Rémy Gibrat;,citation_author=Hervé Sentenac;,citation_author=Xavier Dumont;,citation_author=Isabelle Gaillard;,citation_author=Nadine Paris;,citation_publication_date=2018-06;,citation_cover_date=2018-06;,citation_year=2018;,citation_issue=25;,citation_doi=10.1073/pnas.1721769115;,citation_issn=0027-8424, 1091-6490;,citation_pmid=29866831;,citation_volume=115;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Proc.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Comparative analysis of polyphenol oxidase from plant and fungal species;,citation_abstract=Polyphenol oxidase from plants and fungi is a metalloenzyme containing a type-3 copper center and is homologous to oxygen-carrying hemocyanin of molluscs.

It is presumed that the same is true of polyphenol oxidase from plants and fungi although the structure of a polyphenol oxidase containing the C-terminal domain has not been determined. We show that a number of important structural features are conserved in the N-terminal domains of polyphenol oxidases from various plants and fungi, including a tyrosine motif which can be considered a landmark indicating the beginning of the linker region connecting the N- and C-terminal domains. Our sequence alignments and secondary structure predictions indicate that the C-terminal domains of polyphenol oxidases are likely to be similar in tertiary structure to that of hemocyanin. Detailed bioinformatics analyses of the linker regions predict that this section of the polypeptide chain is intrinsically disordered (lacking fixed tertiary structure) and contains a site of proteolytic processing as well as a potential phosphorylation site.;,citation_author=Carrie M.

We have identified calcium-dependent protein kinase CPK28 from Arabidopsis thaliana as a regulatory component that controls stem elongation and vascular development. In two independent mutant alleles of cpk28, a reduction of stem elongation, accompanied by shorter leaf petioles and enhanced anthocyanin levels, is observed upon the transition to the generative phase. Anatomical analysis revealed an altered vascular pattern characterised by fewer xylem tracheary elements but at the same time increased lignification and secondary growth. Coincident with these morphological changes, cpk28 mutants showed altered expression of NAC transcriptional regulators NST1 and NST3 as well as of GA3ox1, a key regulator of gibberellic acid homeostasis. In vitro protein kinase activity of CPK28 is strictly calcium-dependent. Furthermore, CPK28 is phosphorylated in vivo at several sites. Site-specific amino acid substitutions at these phosphorylation sites resulted in reduced in vitro activity. However, when introduced into a cpk28 mutant background, wild-type and phosphorylation site variants, but not kinase-inactive variants of CPK28 complemented the morphological and developmental defects.

In mammals, the M17 and M1 enzymes with LAP activity contribute to processing peptides for MHC I antigen presentation, processing of bioactive peptides (oxytocin, vasopressin, enkephalins), and vesicle trafficking to the plasma membrane. In microbes, the M17 LAPs have a role in proteolysis and have also acquired the ability to bind DNA. This property enables LAPs to serve as transcriptional repressors to control pyrimidine, alginate and cholera toxin biosynthesis, as well as mediate site-specific recombination events in plasmids and phages.

This technique, which is extremely sensitive and can collect such a snapshot in fractions of a second, is particularly suited for studying gross biochemical changes. The other technique, Raman microscopy (also known as Raman micro-spectroscopy), is ideally suited to study variations of cellular composition on the scale of subcellular organelles, since its spatial resolution is as good as that of fluorescence microscopy.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Polyphenol oxidases in plants and fungi: Going places? A review;,citation_abstract=The more recent reports on polyphenol oxidase in plants and fungi are reviewed. The main aspects considered are the structure, distribution, location and properties of polyphenol oxidase (PPO) as well as newly discovered inhibitors of the enzyme. Particular stress is given to the possible function of the enzyme. The cloning and characterization of a large number of PPOs is surveyed. Although the active site of the enzyme is conserved, the amino acid sequence shows very considerable variability among species. Most plants and fungi PPO have multiple forms of PPO. Expression of the genes coding for the enzyme is tissue specific and also developmentally controlled. Many inhibitors of PPO have been described, which belong to very diverse chemical structures; however, their usefulness for controlling PPO activity remains in doubt. The function of PPO still remains enigmatic. In plants the positive correlation between levels of PPO and the resistance to pathogens and herbivores is frequently observed, but convincing proof of a causal relationship, in most cases, still has not been published. Evidence for the induction of PPO in plants, particularly under conditions of stress and pathogen attack is considered, including the role of jasmonate in the induction process. A clear role of PPO in a least two biosynthetic processes has been clearly demonstrated. In both cases a very high degree of substrate specificity has been found. In fungi, the function of PPO is probably different from that in plants, but there is some evidence indicating that here too PPO has a role in defense against pathogens. PPO also may be a pathogenic factor during the attack of fungi on other organisms. Although many details about structure and probably function of PPO have been revealed in the period reviewed, some of the basic questions raised over the years remain to be answered. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Since their initial characterization in 1992, a number of studies have provided an understanding of the origin and evolution of this protein family. Here, we report a comprehensive evolutionary analysis of non-animal peroxidases using integrated in silico and biochemical approaches. Thanks to the availability of numerous genomic sequences from more than 2500 species belonging to 14 kingdoms together with expert and comprehensive annotation of peroxidase sequences that have been centralized in a dedicated database, we have been able to use phylogenetic reconstructions to increase our understanding of the evolutionary processes underlying the diversification of non-animal peroxidases. We analysed the distribution of all non-animal peroxidases in more than 200 eukaryotic organisms in silico. First, we show that the presence or absence of non-animal peroxidases correlates with the presence or absence of certain organelles or with specific biological processes. Examination of almost 2000 organisms determined that ascorbate peroxidases (APxs) and cytochrome c peroxidases (CcPs) are present in those containing chloroplasts and mitochondria, respectively. Plants, which contain both organelles, are an exception and contain only APxs without CcP. Class II peroxidases (CII Prxs) are only found in fungi with wood-decay and plant-degradation abilities.

Laccase-like multicopper oxidase (LMCO) sequences culled from GenBank and the Arabidopsis thaliana genome, as well as those from several newly cloned genes, were used to construct a gene phylogeny that clearly divided plant LMCOs into six distinct classes, at least three of which predate the evolutionary divergence of angiosperms and gymnosperms. Alignments of the predicted amino acid sequences highlighted regions of variable sequence flanked by the highly conserved copper-binding domains that characterize members of this enzyme family. All of the predicted proteins contained apparent signal sequences. The expression of 13 of the 17 LMCO genes in A. thaliana was assessed in different tissues at various stages of development using RT-PCR. A diversity of expression patterns was demonstrated with some genes being expressed in a constitutive fashion, while others were only expressed in specific tissues at a particular stage of development. Only a few of the LMCO genes were expressed in a pattern that could be considered consistent with a major role for these enzymes in lignin deposition. These results are discussed in the context of other potential physiological functions for plant LMCOs, such as iron metabolism and wound healing.;,citation_author=Bonnie C.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Bryophytes are not early diverging land plants;,citation_abstract=Phylogenetic trees have permeated biology. However, an understanding of how to interpret phylogenies has lagged behind, notably in publications outside of evolutionary biology. Here I argue that some language commonly used in plant systematics has contributed to the confusion by describing phylogenetic trees using intuitive but misleading terms reminiscent of Aristotle’s Scala Natura. These terms (perhaps inadvertently) misrepresent evolution, not as a process acting on all living species, but rather as a progression of successively diverging lineages leading to a group that represents a subjectively defined endpoint. My goal here is to show how thinking of the tree of life in terms of early-diverging lineages and higher groups can distort evolutionary literacy, confound interdisciplinary communication, and potentially bias research agendas. I focus on the relationship between bryophytes and angiosperms as a case study, but the theme applies to all branches of the tree of life. Fortunately evolutionary biologists have developed an easily understood alternative framework – tree thinking – which I highlight as a means to promote a clear understanding of phylogenies across sub-disciplines of biology, and between practicing biologists and students, or members the public which funds much of our work.;,citation_author=Stuart F.

Equal amounts of proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and polypeptides were identified that were more abundant in soluble and cell wall-associated extracts from the developing xylem of either compression or non-compression wood. Two polypeptides (at apparent M(r)s of 48 kDa and 120 kDa) that were more abundant in cell wall-associated extracts of the developing xylem of the compression tissues were selected for amino-terminal protein sequencing. The 48 kDa polypeptide yielded an amino-terminal sequence that had no homology with known protein, gene or EST database sequences.

These parameters are determined largely by cell wall characteristics. Cellulose microfibrils, composed of hydrogen-bonded \beta-1,4 glucans, are key components for anisotropic growth in plants. Cellulose is synthesized by plasma membrane–localized cellulose synthase complexes. In higher plants, these complexes are assembled into hexameric rosettes in intracellular compartments and secreted to the plasma membrane. Here, the complexes typically track along cortical microtubules, which may guide cellulose synthesis, until the complexes are inactivated and/or internalized. Determining the regulatory aspects that control the behavior of cellulose synthase complexes is vital to understanding directed cell and plant growth and to tailoring cell wall content for industrial products, including paper, textiles, and fuel.

We identified members of a family of seven transmembrane domain-containing proteins (7TMs) that are important for cellulose production during cell wall integrity stress. 7TMs are often associated with guanine nucleotide-binding (G) protein signaling and we found that mutants affecting the G\beta\gamma dimer phenocopied the 7tm mutants. Unexpectedly, the 7TMs localized to the Golgi/trans-Golgi network where they interacted with G protein components. Here, the 7TMs and G\beta\gamma regulated CESA trafficking but did not affect general protein secretion.

We inserted microelectrodes into stems of three tree species to measure diurnal changes in [CO2] in the xylem sap. A diurnal pattern with depression during the day and elevation at night was observed. Mean daily [CO2] ranged from 1.6 to 10.3 mmol l(-1).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Characterization of the single FERONIA homolog in Marchantia polymorpha reveals an ancestral role of CrRLK1L receptor kinases in regulating cell expansion and morphological integrity;,citation_abstract=Plant cells are surrounded by a cell wall, a rigid structure rich in polysaccharides and glycoproteins. The cell wall is not only important for cell and organ shape, but crucial for intercellular communication, plant-microbe interactions, and as a barrier to the environment. In the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana, the 17 members of the Catharanthus roseus RLK1-like (CrRLK1L) receptor kinase subfamily are involved in a multitude of physiological and developmental processes involving the cell wall, including reproduction, hormone signaling, cell expansion, innate immunity, and various stress responses. Due to genetic redundancy and the fact that individual CrRLK1Ls can have distinct and sometimes opposing functions, it is difficult to assess the primary or ancestral function of CrRLK1Ls. To reduce genetic complexity, we characterized the single CrRLK1L gene of Marchantia polymorpha, MpFERONIA (MpFER). Plants with reduced MpFER levels show defects in vegetative development, i.e., rhizoid formation and cell expansion, but also affect male fertility. In contrast, Mpfer null mutants and overexpression lines severely affect cell integrity and morphogenesis of the gametophyte. Thus, the CrRLK1L gene family originated from a single gene with an ancestral function in cell expansion and the maintenance of cellular integrity. During land plant evolution, this ancestral gene diversified and was recruited to fulfil a multitude of specialized physiological and developmental and roles in the formation of both gametophytic and sporophytic structures essential to the life cycle of flowering plants.;,citation_author=Martin A.

The ZL mode yielded 0-57%/initial CA of unsoluble condensed DHPs (thioacidolysis yields &amp;amp;amp;lt;200 \mumol g-1) with a proportion of uncondensed CA end groups increasing with the HRP/CA ratio (7.2-55.5%/total uncondensed CA). Systematically lower polymer yields (0-49%/initial CA) were obtained for the ZT mode. In that mode, a negative correlation was established between the \beta-O-4 content (thioacidolysis yields: 222-660 \mumol g-1) and the HRP/CA ratio. In both modes, decreasing the HRP/CA ratio below 18 U mmol-1 favoured an end-wise polymerization process evidenced by the occurrence of tri-, tetra- and pentamers involving at least one \beta-O-4 bond. At low ratio, the unsoluble ZT DHP was found to better approximate natural lignins than DHPs previously synthesized with traditional methods. Besides its possible implication in lignin biosynthesis, peroxidase activity is a crucial parameter accounting for the structural variations of in vitro DHPs. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In plant, class III peroxidases are heme-containing enzymes encoded by a large multi-gene family participated in the release or consumption of ROS. The specific function of each member of the family is still elusive. Here, we showed that ROS was significantly generated during cotton fiber initiation and elongation, whereas, application of NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) and peroxidase inhibitor salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM) to the wild-type cotton ovule culture significantly suppressed fiber growth, respectively. Their inhibitory effects were caused by the reduction of superoxide radical (O2-). Ten GhPOX genes (cDNAs) encoding cotton class III peroxidases were isolated, among them eight GhPOX genes were reported for the first time. Microarray analyses indicated that GhPOX1 was the mostly predominantly expressed in fast-elongating cotton fiber cells. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis revealed the transcript level of GhPOX1 was over 400-fold higher in growing fiber cells than in ovules, flowers, roots, stems and leaves. To reveal the role of GhPOX1 in plant development, its Arabidopsis orthologue atpox13 mutant was demonstrated to be defective in branch root development. Taken together, the data suggest that GhPOX1 plays an important role during fiber cell elongation possibly by mediating production of reactive oxygen species. © 2009 Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology and the Genetics Society of China.;,citation_author=Wenqian Mei;,citation_author=Yongmei Qin;,citation_author=Wenqiang Song;,citation_author=Jun Li;,citation_author=Yuxian Zhu;,citation_publication_date=2009;,citation_cover_date=2009;,citation_year=2009;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1016/S1673-8527(08)60101-0;,citation_isbn=1673-8527 (Print){\textbackslash}r1673-8527 (Linking);,citation_issn=16738527;,citation_pmid=19302970;,citation_volume=36;,citation_journal_title=J.

Here, we investigated the roles of this lignin biochemical specificity for cellular functions by producing single cell analyses for three cell morphotypes of tracheary elements, which all allow sap conduction but differ in their morphology. We determined that specific lignin chemistries accumulate in each cell type. Moreover, lignin accumulated dynamically, increasing in quantity and changing in composition, to alter the cell wall biomechanics during cell maturation. For similar aromatic substitutions, residues with alcohol aliphatic functions increased stiffness whereas aldehydes increased flexibility of the cell wall. Modifying this lignin biochemical specificity and the sequence of its formation impaired the cell wall biomechanics of each morphotype and consequently hindered sap conduction and drought recovery.

In compatible host/pathogen-interactions, the fungus participates in the host’s metabolism by establishing functional haustoria in the susceptible plant cells. In highly resistant wheat cultivars, fungal attack is stopped by a hypersensitive response of penetrated host cells. This mechanism of programmed cell death of single plant cells is accompanied by the intracellular accumulation of material with UV-fluorescence typical of phenolic compounds. A similar reaction can be induced in healthy wheat leaves by the application of a rust-derived elicitor. We analysed the biochemical composition of this defense-induced phenolic material. Contents of total soluble and cell wall esterified and etherified phenolic acids were determined in rust-inoculated and elicitor-treated leaves of the fully susceptible wheat cultivar Prelude and its highly resistant, near-isogenic line Prelude-Sr5. While no resistance-related changes occured in any of these fractions, the lignin content as determined by the thioglycolic acid and the acetyl bromide methods increased after elicitor treatment. Nitrobenzene oxidation revealed that the entire increase can be explained by an increase in syringyl units only. These biochemical data were confirmed by fluorescence emission spectra analyses which indicated a defense-induced enrichment of syringyl lignin for cell wall samples both from elicitor-treated wheat leaves and single host cells undergoing a hypersensitive response upon fungal penetration.;,citation_author=Barbara Menden;,citation_author=Markus Kohlhoff;,citation_author=Bruno M.

Hypoxia imposed either artificially or by the glumellae to embryos from dormant grains, increases embryo sensitivity to abscisic acid (ABA) and promotes the accumulation of ABA during the first hours after imbibition. Expression of candidate genes involved in ABA synthesis (HvNCED), catabolism (HvABA8OH1) and signalling (HvABI5, HvVP1 and HvPKABA) was analysed in embryos isolated from dormant whole or de-hulled grains incubated in air or in hypoxia (5% oxygen). The presence of the glumellae enhanced the expression of genes involved in ABA metabolism and signalling with respect to that observed in de-hulled grains incubated in air. These results suggest that at least part of the observed physiological responses to the presence of the glumellae are regulated at the level of gene expression. However, hypoxia imposed on dormant de-hulled grains did not mimic the presence of the glumellae in terms of expression of candidate genes. Hypoxia mimics the presence of the glumellae in terms of dormancy maintenance and ABA accumulation and sensitivity, but its effects appear to operate through different mechanisms.;,citation_author=Guillermina M.

The new expression system resulted in a 5-fold increase in purified enzyme obtained from a 5 L fermentor growth. The as-purified PfMetAP-II enzyme, to which no exogenous metal ions or EDTA was added, was found to have 1.2 equiv of zinc and 0.1 equiv of iron present by ICP-AES analysis. This enzyme had a specific activity of 5 units/mg, a 60-fold decrease from the fully loaded Fe(II) enzymes. When an additional 2 equiv of Zn(II) was added to the as-purified PfMetAP-II, no activity could be detected. The combination of these data with previously reported whole cell studies on EcMetAP-I further supports the suggestion that the in vivo metal ion for all MetAP’s is Fe(II). Both Co(II)- and Fe(II)-loaded PfMetAP-II showed similar substrate specificities to EcMetAP-I. Substrate binding was largely affected by the amino acid in the P1 position and the length of the polypeptide. The substrates MSSHRWDW and MP-p-NA showed the smallest K(m) values while the substrates MGMM and MP-p-NA provided the highest turnover. The catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/K(m)) of PfMetAP-II for MP-p-NA at 30 degrees C was 799 500 and 340 930 M(-1) s(-1) for Co(II)- and Fe(II)-loaded PfMetAP-II, respectively. Maximum catalytic activity was obtained with 1 equiv of Co(II) or Fe(II), and the dissociation constants (K(d)) for the first metal binding site were found to be 50 +/- 15 and 20 +/- 15 nM for Co(II)- and Fe(II)-substituted PfMetAP-II, respectively. Electronic absorption spectral titration of a 1 mM sample of apo-PfMetAP-II with Co(II) provided a dissociation constant of 0.35 +/- 0.02 mM for the second metal binding site, a 17500-fold increase compared to the first metal binding site. The electronic absorption data also indicated that both Co(II) ions reside in a pentacoordinate geometry. PfMetAP-II shows unique thermostability and the optimal temperature for substrate turnover was found to be approximately 85 degrees C at pH 7.5 in 25 mM Hepes and 150 mM KCl buffer. The hydrolysis of MGMM was measured in triplicate between 25 and 85 degrees C at eight substrate concentrations ranging from 2 to 20 mM. Both specific activity and K(m) values increased with increasing temperature. An Arrhenius plot was constructed from the k(cat) values and was found to be linear over the temperature range 25-85 degrees C, indicating that the rate-limiting step in PfMetAP-II peptide hydrolysis does not change as a function of temperature. Co(II)- and Fe(II)-loaded PfMetAP-II have similar activation energies (13.3 and 19.4 kJ/mol, respectively). The thermodynamic parameters calculated at 25 degrees C are as follows: DeltaG++ = 46.23 kJ/mol, DeltaH++ = 10.79 kJ/mol, and DeltaS++ = -119.72 J.mol(-1).K(-1) for Co(II)-loaded PfMetAP; DeltaG++ = 46.44 kJ/mol, DeltaH++ = 16.94 kJ/mol, and DeltaS++ = -99.67 J.mol(-1).K(-1) for Fe(II)-loaded PfMetAP.

Despite their importance in brown algae, phlorotannin biosynthetic pathways have been poorly characterized at the molecular level. We found that a predicted type III polyketide synthase in the genome of the brown alga Ectocarpus siliculosus, PKS1, catalyzes a major step in the biosynthetic pathway of phlorotannins (i.e., the synthesis of phloroglucinol monomers from malonyl-CoA). The crystal structure of PKS1 at 2.85-Å resolution provided a good quality electron density map showing a modified Cys residue, likely connected to a long chain acyl group. An additional pocket not found in other known type III PKSs contains a reaction product that might correspond to a phloroglucinol precursor. In vivo, we also found a positive correlation between the phloroglucinol content and the PKS III gene expression level in cells of a strain of Ectocarpus adapted to freshwater during its reacclimation to seawater.

Ferulate-5-hydroxylase (F5H) catalyzes an irreversible hydroxylation step in this pathway that diverts ferulic acid away from guaiacyl lignin biosynthesis and toward sinapic acid and syringyl lignin. This fact led us to postulate that F5H was a potential regulatory step in the determination of lignin monomer composition. To test this hypothesis, we have used Arabidopsis to examine the impact of F5H overexpression. Arabidopsis is a useful model system in which to study lignification because in wild-type plants, guaiacyl and syringyl lignins are deposited in a tissue-specific fashion, while the F5H-deficient fah1 mutant accumulates only guaiacyl lignin. Here we show that ectopic overexpression of F5H in Arabidopsis abolishes tissue-specific lignin monomer accumulation. Surprisingly, overexpression of F5H under the control of the lignification-associated cinnamate-4-hydroxylase promoter, but not the commonly employed cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter, generates a lignin that is almost entirely comprised of syringylpropane units.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=ATP-binding cassette-like transporters are involved in the transport of lignin precursors across plasma and vacuolar membranes;,citation_abstract=Lignin is a complex biopolymer derived primarily from the condensation of three monomeric precursors, the monolignols. The synthesis of monolignols occurs in the cytoplasm. To reach the cell wall where they are oxidized and polymerized, they must be transported across the cell membrane. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the transport process are unclear. There are conflicting views about whether the transport of these precursors occurs by passive diffusion or is an energized active process; further, we know little about what chemical forms are required. Using isolated plasma and vacuolar membrane vesicles prepared from Arabidopsis, together with applying different transporter inhibitors in the assays, we examined the uptake of monolignols and their derivatives by these native membrane vesicles. We demonstrate that the transport of lignin precursors across plasmalemma and their sequestration into vacuoles are ATP-dependent primary-transport processes, involving ATP-binding cassette-like transporters. Moreover, we show that both plasma and vacuolar membrane vesicles selectively transport different forms of lignin precursors. In the presence of ATP, the inverted plasma membrane vesicles preferentially take up monolignol aglycones, whereas the vacuolar vesicles are more specific for glucoconjugates, suggesting that the different ATP-binding cassette-like transporters recognize different chemical forms in conveying them to distinct sites, and that glucosylation of monolignols is necessary for their vacuolar storage but not required for direct transport into the cell wall in Arabidopsis.;,citation_author=Yu-Chen Miao;,citation_author=Chang-Jun Liu;,citation_publication_date=2010-12;,citation_cover_date=2010-12;,citation_year=2010;,citation_issue=52;,citation_doi=10.1073/pnas.1007747108;,citation_issn=0027-8424, 1091-6490;,citation_pmid=21149736;,citation_volume=107;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Proc.

Here we introduce two fluorescent molecular sensors, CWP-BDP and NR12S, that reveal the micromechanical response of the cell wall-plasma membrane continuum in P. infestans during invasive growth and upon chemical treatment. When visualized by live-cell imaging, CWP-BDP reports changes in cell wall (CW) porosity while NR12S reports variations in chemical polarity and lipid order in the plasma membrane (PM). During invasive growth, mechanical interactions between the pathogen and a surface reveal clear and localized changes in the structure of the CW. Moreover, the molecular sensors can reveal the effect of chemical treatment to CW and/or PM, thereby revealing the site-of-action of crop protection agents.

Total guaiacol peroxidase activities from soluble and microsomal fractions of maize roots were compared and showed weak changes. By contrast, total plasma membrane and washed plasma membrane peroxidase activities, representing peripheral and integral membrane proteins, revealed strong changes after all of the stresses applied.

At least two distinct peroxidase activities could be separated by cation exchange chromatography (pmPOX1 and pmPOX2). Prosthetic groups were identified in fractions with peroxidase activity by absorption spectra, and the corresponding protein bands were identified by heme staining. The activities of the peroxidase enzymes responded different to various substrates and effectors and had different thermal stabilities and pH and temperature optima. Because the enzymes were localized at the PM and were not effected by p-chloromercuribenzoate, they were probably class III peroxidases. Additional size exclusion chromatography of pmPOX1 revealed a single activity peak with a molecular mass of 70 kD for the native enzyme, whereas pmPOX2 had two activity peaks (155 and 40 kD).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Crystallographic, kinetic, and spectroscopic study of the first ligninolytic peroxidase presenting a catalytic tyrosine;,citation_abstract=Trametes cervina lignin peroxidase (LiP) is a unique enzyme lacking the catalytic tryptophan strictly conserved in all other LiPs and versatile peroxidases (more than 30 sequences available). Recombinant T. cervina LiP and site-directed variants were investigated by crystallographic, kinetic, and spectroscopic techniques. The crystal structure shows three substrate oxidation site candidates involving His-170, Asp-146, and Tyr-181. Steady-state kinetics for oxidation of veratryl alcohol (the typical LiP substrate) by variants at the above three residues reveals a crucial role of Tyr-181 in LiP activity. Moreover, assays with ferrocytochrome c show that its ability to oxidize large molecules (a requisite property for oxidation of the lignin polymer) originates in Tyr-181. This residue is also involved in the oxidation of 1,4-dimethoxybenzene, a reaction initiated by the one-electron abstraction with formation of substrate cation radical, as described for the well known Phanerochaete chrysosporium LiP. Detailed spectroscopic and kinetic investigations, including low temperature EPR, show that the porphyrin radical in the two-electron activated T. cervina LiP is unstable and rapidly receives one electron from Tyr-181, forming a catalytic protein radical, which is identified as an H-bonded neutral tyrosyl radical. The crystal structure reveals a partially exposed location of Tyr-181, compatible with its catalytic role, and several neighbor residues probably contributing to catalysis: (i) by enabling substrate recognition by aromatic interactions; (ii) by acting as proton acceptor/donor from Tyr-181 or H-bonding the radical form; and (iii) by providing the acidic environment that would facilitate oxidation.

Here we report a novel small archaeal modifier protein (named SAMP3) with a \beta-grasp fold and C-terminal diglycine motif characteristic of ubiquitin that is functional in protein conjugation in <i>Hfx. volcanii</i>. SAMP3 conjugates were dependent on the ubiquitin-activating E1 enzyme homolog of archaea (UbaA) for synthesis and were cleaved by the JAMM/MPN+ domain metalloprotease HvJAMM1. Twenty-three proteins (28 lysine residues) were found to be isopeptide-linked to the C-terminal carboxylate of SAMP3, and 331 proteins were reproducibly found associated with SAMP3 in a UbaA-dependent manner based on tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis. The molybdopterin (MPT) synthase large subunit homolog MoaE, found samp3ylated at conserved active site lysine residues in MS/MS analysis, was also shown to be covalently bound to SAMP3 by immunoprecipitation and tandem affinity purifications. HvJAMM1 was demonstrated to catalyze the cleavage of SAMP3 from MoaE, suggesting a mechanism of controlling MPT synthase activity. The levels of samp3ylated proteins and <i>samp3</i> transcripts were found to be increased by the addition of dimethyl sulfoxide to aerobically growing cells. Thus, we propose a model in which samp3ylation is covalent and reversible and controls the activity of enzymes such as MPT synthase. Sampylation of MPT synthase may govern the levels of molybdenum cofactor available and thus facilitate the scavenging of oxygen prior to the transition to respiration with molybdenum-cofactor-containing terminal reductases that use alternative electron acceptors such as dimethyl sulfoxide. Overall, our study of SAMP3 provides new insight into the diversity of functional ubiquitin-like protein modifiers and the network of ubiquitin-like protein targets in Archaea.</p>;,citation_author=Hugo V.

In this work, we have identified and characterized two new knockout mutants for CCR1. Both have a dwarf phenotype and a delayed senescence. At complete maturity, their inflorescence stems display a 25-35% decreased lignin level, some alterations in lignin structure with a higher frequency of resistant interunit bonds and a higher content in cell wall-bound ferulic esters. Ferulic acid-coniferyl alcohol ether dimers were found for the first time in dicot cell walls and in similar levels in wild-type and mutant plants. The expression of CCR2, a CCR gene usually involved in plant defense, was increased in the mutants and could account for the biosynthesis of lignins in the CCR1-knockout plants. Mutant plantlets have three to four-times less sinapoyl malate (SM) than controls and accumulate some feruloyl malate. The same compositional changes occurred in the rosette leaves of greenhouse-grown plants. By contrast and relative to the control, their stems accumulated unusually high levels of both SM and feruloyl malate as well as more kaempferol glycosides. These findings suggest that, in their hypolignified stems, the mutant plants would avoid the feruloyl-CoA accumulation by its redirection to cell wall-bound ferulate esters, to feruloyl malate and to SM. The formation of feruloyl malate to an extent far exceeding the levels reported so far indicates that ferulic acid is a potential substrate for the enzymes involved in SM biosynthesis and emphasizes the remarkable plasticity of Arabidopsis phenylpropanoid metabolism.;,citation_author=Mohammad Mir Derikvand;,citation_author=Jimmy Berrio Sierra;,citation_author=Katia Ruel;,citation_author=Brigitte Pollet;,citation_author=Cao-Trung Do;,citation_author=Johanne Thévenin;,citation_author=Dominique Buffard;,citation_author=Lise Jouanin;,citation_author=Catherine Lapierre;,citation_publication_date=2008-04;,citation_cover_date=2008-04;,citation_year=2008;,citation_issue=5;,citation_doi=10.1007/s00425-007-0669-x;,citation_isbn=0032-0935 (Print){\textbackslash}r0032-0935 (Linking);,citation_issn=0032-0935;,citation_pmid=18046574;,citation_volume=227;,citation_journal_title=Planta;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Transcriptome sequencing and profiling of expressed genes in cambial zone and differentiating xylem of Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica);,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Forest trees have ecological and economic importance, and Japanese cedar has highly valued wood attributes. Thus, studies of molecular aspects of wood formation offer practical information that may be used for screening and forward genetics approaches to improving wood quality.\n\nRESULTS: After identifying expressed sequence tags in Japanese cedar tissue undergoing xylogenesis, we designed a custom cDNA microarray to compare expression of highly regulated genes throughout a growing season. This led to identification of candidate genes involved both in wood formation and later cessation of growth and dormancy. Based on homology to orthologous protein groups, the genes were assigned to functional classes. A high proportion of sequences fell into functional classes related to posttranscriptional modification and signal transduction, while transcription factors and genes involved in the metabolism of sugars, cell-wall synthesis and lignification, and cold hardiness were among other classes of genes identified as having a potential role in xylem formation and seasonal wood formation.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: We obtained 55,051 unique sequences by next-generation sequencing of a cDNA library prepared from cambial meristem and derivative cells. Previous studies on conifers have identified unique sequences expressed in developing xylem, but this is the first comprehensive study utilizing a collection of expressed sequence tags for expression studies related to xylem formation in Japanese cedar, which belongs to a different lineage than the Pinaceae.

However, a few studies have also reported Tyr phosphorylation in plants, but the relative contribution of tyrosine phosphorylation to plant signal transduction has remained an open question. We present an approach to selectively measure and quantify Tyr phosphorylation in plant cells, which can also be applied to whole plants. We combined a 15N stable isotope metabolic labeling strategy with an immuno-affinity purification using phospho-tyrosine (pY) specific antibodies. This single enrichment strategy was sufficient to reproducibly identify and quantify pY containing peptides from total plant cell extract in a single LC–MS/MS run. We succeeded in identifying 149 unique pY peptides originating from 135 proteins, including a large set of different protein kinases and several receptor-like kinases. We used flagellin perception by Arabidopsis cells, a model system for pathogen triggered immune (PTI) signaling, to test our approach. We reproducibly quantified 23 pY peptides in 2 inversely labeled biological replicates identifying 11 differentially phosphorylated proteins.

Plants with double, but not single, T-DNA–tagged lines for NST1 and NST2 had the same anther-indehiscent phenotype as transgenic plants that expressed the individual chimeric repressors, indicating that NST1 and NST2 are redundant in regulating secondary wall thickening in anther walls. The activity of the NST2 promoter was particularly strong in anther tissue, while that of the NST1 promoter was detected in various tissues in which lignified secondary walls develop. Ectopic expression of NST1 or NST2 induced ectopic thickening of secondary walls in various aboveground tissues.

In this study, we show that plant-specific transcription factors, designated NAC SECONDARY WALL THICKENING PROMOTING FACTOR1 (NST1) and NST3, are key regulators of the formation of secondary walls in woody tissues of Arabidopsis thaliana. In nst1-1 nst3-1 double knockout plants, the secondary wall thickenings in interfascicular fibers and secondary xylem, except for vascular vessels, were completely suppressed without affecting formation of cells destined to be woody tissues. Conversely, as shown previously for NST1, overexpression of NST3 induced ectopic secondary wall thickenings in various aboveground tissues. Furthermore, the expression of chimeric repressors derived from NST1 and NST3 suppressed secondary wall thickenings in the presumptive interfascicular fibers. Because putative orthologs of NST1 and NST3 are present in the genome of poplar, our results suggest that they are also key regulators of the formation of secondary walls in woody plants and could be used as a tool for the genetic engineering of wood and its derivatives.;,citation_author=Nobutaka Mitsuda;,citation_author=Akira Iwase;,citation_author=Hiroyuki Yamamoto;,citation_author=Masato Yoshida;,citation_author=Motoaki Seki;,citation_author=Kazuo Shinozaki;,citation_author=Masaru Ohme-Takagi;,citation_publication_date=2007-01;,citation_cover_date=2007-01;,citation_year=2007;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1105/tpc.106.047043;,citation_issn=1040-4651;,citation_volume=19;,citation_journal_title=Plant Cell;">

However, the role of the secondary wall has not been proven, and the factors that regulate its formation in siliques remain to be characterized. We show here that secondary wall formation in siliques is necessary for dehiscence, and that two plant-specific transcription factors, NAC SECONDARY WALL THICKENING PROMOTING FACTOR 1 and 3 (NST1 and NST3), regulate its formation in siliques of Arabidopsis. The promoters of the NST1 and NST3 genes were active in the valve endocarp layer and in cells surrounding vascular vessels in the replum, and NST1 promoter activity only was faintly detectable at valve margins. In nst1 mutants, specific loss of secondary walls was evident at valve margins, while nst1 nst3 double mutants lacked secondary walls in all parts of the siliques, with the exception of vascular vessels. These siliques were similarly indehiscent. The promoters of two tissue-identity genes, INDEHISCENT (IND) and SHATTERPROOF2 (SHP2), were as active in the nst1 nst3 mutant as in the wild-type.

In substrate gel electrophoresis, hyaluronan (HA) is impregnated in a gel. To determine the presence of degradation enzymes for other glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), the sizes of whose molecules are much smaller than that of HA, we have developed a technique by which chondroitin sulfate (CS) is chemically modified by introducing an allyl group at the reducing end for its immobilization in the gel. Enzymes with CS-degrading activity were detected on a CS-copolymerized gel in the presence or absence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. The smallest amount of chondroitinase ABC and HAase was found to be 8 microU and 0.35 mU, respectively. By zymography using HA-impregnated and modified CS-copolymerized gels human serum HAase has been shown to consist of at least two isoforms each with its own substrate specificity. Using this method, uterine tumor tissue has been shown to secrete a novel HAase which degrades HA at neutral pH, but not CS at any pH.

To obtain a more detailed knowledge of the small gene family encoding membrane-anchored endo-1,4-\beta-D-glucanases in Arabidopsis thaliana, we have characterized two additional membrane-anchored endo-1,4-\beta-D-glucanase genes. Sequence comparison indicates that KOR2 is distantly related to KOR and other plant membrane-anchored endo-1,4-\beta-D-glucanases. The expression of KOR2 and KOR3 was followed by the \beta-glucuronidase (gusA) reporter-gene method. While the KOR gene is most often expressed throughout the plant, KOR2::gusA and KOR3::gusA are active only in restricted cell types. We demonstrate that KOR2::gusA is expressed very early in the development of root hairs within the root differentiation zone (specialization zone) but not in the root-hair-bearing epidermal cells at the root/shoot junction (transition zone). Furthermore, KOR2::gusA is expressed in the proximal parts of leaves and floral organs (rosette and cauline leaves, sepals, petals and stamens), and in trichomes, as they develop at the tip of young leaves and later in more basal regions of the leaf blade. The KOR3::gusA construct is expressed in the trichome support cells that form a ring at the base of each trichome and in the bundle sheath cells which surround the vascular bundle within the leaf mesophyll tissue. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction of Arabidopsis RNA confirmed the expression of KOR2::gusA and KOR3::gusA.

Grandiflora</i>: A polyphenol oxidase with unique characteristics;,citation_abstract=MAIN CONCLUSION: Aurone synthase belongs to the novel group 2 polyphenol oxidases and the presented kinetic characterization suggests a differing aurone biosynthesis in Asteraceae species compared to snapdragon. Aurone synthases (AUS) are polyphenol oxidases (PPO) physiologically involved in the formation of yellow aurone pigments in petals of various Asteraceae species. They catalyze the oxidative conversion of chalcones into aurones. Latent (58.9 kDa) and active (41.6 kDa) aurone synthase from petals of C. grandiflora was purified by a quantitative removal of pigments using aqueous two-phase separation and several subsequent chromatographic steps. The purified enzymes were identified as cgAUS1 (A0A075DN54) and sequence analysis revealed that cgAUS1 is a member of a new group of plant PPOs. Mass determination experiments of intact cgAUS1 gave evidence that the C-terminal domain, usually shielding the active site of latent polyphenol oxidases, is linked to the main core by a disulfide bond. This is a novel and unique structural feature of plant PPOs. Proteolytic activation in vivo leads to active aurone synthase possessing a residual peptide of the C-terminal domain. Kinetic characterization of purified cgAUS1 strongly suggests a specific involvement in 4-deoxyaurone biosynthesis in Coreopsis grandiflora (Asteraceae) that differs in various aspects compared to the 4-hydroxyaurone formation in Antirrhinum majus (Plantaginaceae): cgAUS1 is predicted to be localized in the thylakoid lumen, it possesses exclusively diphenolase activity and the results suggest that aurone formation occurs at the level of chalcone aglycones. The latent enzyme exhibits allosteric activation which changes at a specific product concentration to a constant reaction rate.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Aurone synthase is a catechol oxidase with hydroxylase activity and provides insights into the mechanism of plant polyphenol oxidases;,citation_abstract=Tyrosinases and catechol oxidases belong to the family of polyphenol oxidases (PPOs). Tyrosinases catalyze the o-hydroxylation and oxidation of phenolic compounds, whereas catechol oxidases were so far defined to lack the hydroxylation activity and catalyze solely the oxidation of o-diphenolic compounds. Aurone synthase from Coreopsis grandiflora (AUS1) is a specialized plant PPO involved in the anabolic pathway of aurones. We present, to our knowledge, the first crystal structures of a latent plant PPO, its mature active and inactive form, caused by a sulfation of a copper binding histidine. Analysis of the latent proenzyme’s interface between the shielding C-terminal domain and the main core provides insights into its activation mechanisms. As AUS1 did not accept common tyrosinase substrates (tyrosine and tyramine), the enzyme is classified as a catechol oxidase. However, AUS1 showed hydroxylase activity toward its natural substrate (isoliquiritigenin), revealing that the hydroxylase activity is not correlated with the acceptance of common tyrosinase substrates. Therefore, we propose that the hydroxylase reaction is a general functionality of PPOs.

Based on the evidenced hydroxylase activity and the interactions of specific residues with the substrates during the molecular dynamics simulations, a novel catalytic reaction mechanism for plant PPOs is proposed.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Spatial consistency of cell growth direction during organ morphogenesis requires CELLULOSE-SYNTHASE INTERACTIVE1;,citation_abstract=Extracellular matrices generally contain fibril-like polymers that may be organized in parallel arrays. Although their role in morphogenesis has been recognized, it is still unclear how the subcellular control of fibril synthesis translates into well-defined organ shape. Here, we addressed this question using the Arabidopsis sepal as a model organ. In plants, cell growth is driven by turgor pressure and restrained by the extracellular matrix known as the cell wall. Cellulose is the main load-bearing component of the plant cell wall and cellulose microfibrils are thought to channel growth perpendicularly to their main orientation. We investigated the role of the guidance of cellulose synthesis by CELLULOSE SYNTHASE INTERACTIVE 1 (CSI1) in sepal morphogenesis. We observed that sepals are shorter in csi1 mutants, although the newest cellulose microfibrils are more aligned in csi1. Surprisingly, cell growth anisotropy was similar in csi1 and wild-type plants. We resolved this apparent paradox using polarized Raman microspectroscopy and live imaging of growing sepals. We found that CSI1 is required for spatial consistency of growth direction across the sepal and for the maintenance of overall organ elongation. We confirmed our conclusions at sepal scale, notably using bespoke mechanical assays. Our work illustrates how the subcellular regulation of the extracellular matrix may control morphogenesis at multiple scales.;,citation_author=Corentin Mollier;,citation_author=Joanna Skrzydeł;,citation_author=Dorota Borowska-Wykret;,citation_author=Mateusz Majda;,citation_author=Mateusz Dulski;,citation_author=Antoine Fruleux;,citation_author=Roman Wrzalik;,citation_author=Richard S.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Mutation bias shapes gene evolution in Arabidopsis thaliana;,citation_abstract=&amp;amp;amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Classical evolutionary theory maintains that mutation rate variation between genes should be random with respect to fitness and evolutionary optimization of genic mutation rates remains controversial. However, it has now become known that cytogenetic (DNA sequence + epigenomic) features influence local mutation probabilities, which is predicted by more recent theory to be a prerequisite for beneficial mutation rates between different classes of genes to readily evolve. To test this possibility, we used de novo mutations in &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Arabidopsis thaliana</i> to create a high resolution predictive model of mutation rates as a function of cytogenetic features across the genome. As expected, mutation rates are significantly predicted by features such as GC content, histone modifications, and chromatin accessibility. Deeper analyses of predicted mutation rates reveal effects of introns and untranslated exon regions in distancing coding sequences from mutational hotspots at the start and end of transcribed regions in <i>A. thaliana</i>. Finally, predicted coding region mutation rates are significantly lower in genes where mutations are more likely to be deleterious, supported by numerous estimates of evolutionary and functional constraint. These findings contradict neutral expectations that mutation probabilities are independent of fitness consequences. Instead they are consistent with the evolution of lower mutation rates in functionally constrained loci due to cytogenetic features, with important implications for evolutionary biology.</p>;,citation_author=J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=REPRISAL: Mapping lignification dynamics using chemistry, data segmentation, and ratiometric analysis;,citation_abstract=This article describes a methodology for detailed mapping of the lignification capacity of plant cell walls that we have called “REPRISAL” for REPorter Ratiometrics Integrating Segmentation for Analyzing Lignification. REPRISAL consists of the combination of three separate approaches. In the first approach, H*, G*, and S* monolignol chemical reporters, corresponding to p-coumaryl alcohol, coniferyl alcohol, and sinapyl alcohol, are used to label the growing lignin polymer in a fluorescent triple labeling strategy based on the sequential use of three main bioorthogonal chemical reactions. In the second step, an automatic parametric and/or artificial intelligence segmentation algorithm is developed that assigns fluorescent image pixels to three distinct cell wall zones corresponding to cell corners, compound middle lamella and secondary cell walls. The last step corresponds to the exploitation of a ratiometric approach enabling statistical analyses of differences in monolignol reporter distribution (ratiometric method [RM] 1) and proportions (RM 2) within the different cell wall zones. We first describe the use of this methodology to map developmentally related changes in the lignification capacity of wild-type Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) interfascicular fiber cells. We then apply REPRISAL to analyze the Arabidopsis peroxidase (PRX) mutant prx64 and provide further evidence for the implication of the AtPRX64 protein in floral stem lignification. In addition, we also demonstrate the general applicability of REPRISAL by using it to map lignification capacity in poplar (Populus tremula  Populus alba), flax (Linum usitatissimum), and maize (Zea mays).

This polymerization process leads to a plethora of units and linkage types that affect the physicochemical characteristics of the cell wall. Current methods to analyze the lignin structure focus only on the frequency of the major monomeric units and interunit linkage types but do not provide information on the presence of less abundant unknown units and linkage types, nor on how linkages affect the formation of neighboring linkages. Such information can only be obtained using a sequencing approach. Here, we describe, to our knowledge for the first time, a sequencing strategy for lignin oligomers using mass spectrometry. This strategy was then evaluated on the oligomers extracted from wild-type poplar (Populus tremula x Populus tremuloides) xylem. In total, 134 lignin trimers to hexamers were observed, of which 36 could be completely sequenced.

The polypeptide backbone of xylogen is a hybrid-type molecule with properties of both arabinogalactan proteins and nonspecific lipid-transfer proteins. Xylogen predominantly accumulates in the meristem, procambium and xylem. In the xylem, xylogen has a polar localization in the cell walls of differentiating tracheary elements. Double knockouts of Arabidopsis lacking both genes that encode xylogen proteins show defects in vascular development: discontinuous veins, improperly interconnected vessel elements and simplified venation.

Various analytical techniques and microscopy methods were employed to examine the composition and distribution of lignin and structural polysaccharides in leatherwood xylem in comparison with trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) and white spruce (Picea glauca). We found that leatherwood has low overall levels of lignin, a high syringyl lignin content, and a unique distribution of lignin. Most remarkably, the cell corners and middle lamellae remain unlignified in mature xylem. These findings help explain the flexibility of leatherwood and also call into question the classical model of lignification, which purports that lignin polymerization begins in the cell corners and middle lamellae.

FT-IR transmission spectra were sampled from native 4-day-old dark-grown hypocotyls of 46 mutants and the wild type treated with various drugs. The Mahalanobis distance between mutants, calculated from the spectral information after compression with the Discriminant Variables Selection procedure, was used for alpha hierarchical cluster analysis. Despite the completely unsupervised nature of the classification procedure, we show that all mutants with cellulose defects appeared in the same cluster. In addition, mutant alleles of similar strength for several unrelated loci were also clustered, which demonstrates the sensitivity of the method to detect a wide array of cell wall defects. Comparing the cellulose-deficient cluster with the cluster that contained wild-type controls led to the identification of wave numbers that were diagnostic for altered cellulose content in the context of an intact cell wall. The results show that FT-IR spectra can be used to identify different classes of mutants and to characterize cell wall changes at a microscopic level in unknown mutants.

In order to elucidate the mode of substrate specificity of these enzymes, we characterized one of the CIIIPRXs (PviPRX9) from switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), a strategic plant for second-generation biofuels. The crystal structure, kinetic experiments, molecular docking, as well as expression patterns of PviPRX9 across multiple tissues and treatments, along with its levels of coexpression with the majority of genes in the monolignol biosynthesis pathway, revealed the function of PviPRX9 in lignification. Significantly, our study suggested that PviPRX9 has the ability to oxidize a broad range of phenylpropanoids with rather similar efficiencies, which reflects its role in the fortification of cell walls during normal growth and root development and in response to insect feeding. Based on the observed interactions of phenylpropanoids in the active site and analysis of kinetics, a catalytic mechanism involving two water molecules and residues histidine-42, arginine-38, and serine-71 was proposed.

Here, we show that LRX8-RALF4 complexes adopt a heterotetrametric configuration in vivo, displaying a dendritic distribution. The LRX8-RALF4 complex specifically interacts with demethylesterified pectins in a charge-dependent manner through RALF4’s polycationic surface. The LRX8-RALF4-pectin interaction exerts a condensing effect, patterning the cell wall’s polymers into a reticulated network essential for wall integrity and expansion.

Upon dilution of neat glycerol with D2O, glycerol hydrogen-bonds with D2O through its oxygen atoms as hydrogen-bond acceptors. With progressive glycerol dilution, D2O breaks the dimers and higher oligomers present in neat glycerol to form glycerol monomers. D2O molecules in the XG 0.02 solution are in an environment similar to that of neat D2O due to minimal perturbation of the D2O network. The absence of bands due to weakly hydrogen-bonded D2O in the XG 0.12 solution suggests that most D2O are more strongly hydrogen-bonded than in neat D2O as would occur in D2O clusters.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The monolignol pathway contributes to the biosynthesis of volatile phenylpropenes in flowers;,citation_abstract=Volatile phenylpropenes play important roles in the mediation of interactions between plants and their biotic environments. Their biosynthesis involves the elimination of the oxygen functionality at the side-chain of monolignols and competes with lignin formation for monolignol utilization. We hypothesized that biochemical steps before the monolignol branch point are shared between phenylpropene and lignin biosynthesis; however, genetic evidence for this shared pathway has been missing until now. Our hypothesis was tested by RNAi suppression of the petunia (Petunia hybrida) cinnamoyl-CoA reductase 1 (PhCCR1), which catalyzes the first committed step in monolignol biosynthesis. Detailed metabolic profiling and isotopic labeling experiments were performed in petunia transgenic lines. Downregulation of PhCCR1 resulted in reduced amounts of total lignin and decreased flux towards phenylpropenes, whereas internal and emitted pools of phenylpropenes remained unaffected. Surprisingly, PhCCR1 silencing increased fluxes through the general phenylpropanoid pathway by upregulating the expression of cinnamate-4-hydroxylase (C4H), which catalyzes the second reaction in the phenylpropanoid pathway. In conclusion, our results show that PhCCR1 is involved in both the biosynthesis of phenylpropenes and lignin production. However, PhCCR1 does not perform a rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of phenylpropenes, suggesting that scent biosynthesis is prioritized over lignin formation in petals.;,citation_author=Joelle K.

We used electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy to show that (*)OH is generated in the cell wall during radicle elongation and weakening of the endosperm of cress (Lepidium sativum; Brassicaceae) seeds. Endosperm weakening precedes radicle emergence, as demonstrated by direct biomechanical measurements. By (3)H fingerprinting, we showed that wall polysaccharides are oxidized in vivo by the developmentally regulated action of apoplastic (*)OH in radicles and endosperm caps: the production and action of (*)OH increased during endosperm weakening and radicle elongation and were inhibited by the germination-inhibiting hormone abscisic acid. Both effects were reversed by gibberellin. Distinct and tissue-specific target sites of (*)OH attack on polysaccharides were evident. In vivo (*)OH attack on cell wall polysaccharides were evident not only in germinating seeds but also in elongating maize (Zea mays; Poaceae) seedling coleoptiles.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Can laccases catalyze bond cleavage in lignin?;,citation_abstract=Modification of lignin is recognized as an important aspect of the successful refining of lignocellulosic biomass, and enzyme-assisted processing and upcycling of lignin is receiving significant attention in the literature. Laccases (EC 1.10.3.2) are taking the centerstage of this attention, since these enzymes may help degrading lignin, using oxygen as the oxidant. Laccases can catalyze polymerization of lignin, but the question is whether and how laccases can directly catalyze modification of lignin via catalytic bond cleavage. Via a thorough review of the available literature and detailed illustrations of the putative laccase catalyzed reactions, including the possible reactions of the reactive radical intermediates taking place after the initial oxidation of the phenol-hydroxyl groups, we show that i) Laccase activity is able to catalyze bond cleavage in low molecular weight phenolic lignin model compounds; ii) For laccases to catalyze inter-unit bond cleavage in lignin substrates, the presence of a mediator system is required. Clearly, the higher the redox potential of the laccase enzyme, the broader the range of substrates, including o- and p-diphenols, aminophenols, methoxy-substituted phenols, benzenethiols, polyphenols, and polyamines, which may be oxidized. In addition, the currently available analytical methods that can be used to detect enzyme catalyzed changes in lignin are summarized, and an improved nomenclature for unequivocal interpretation of the action of laccases on lignin is proposed.;,citation_author=Line Munk;,citation_author=Anna K.

Laccases (EC 1.10.3.2) catalyze oxidation of phenolic hydroxyls using O2 as electron acceptor and may facilitate lignin modification in the presence of mediators. This study assessed the reactivity of four different synthetic mediators by laccases from Trametes versicolor and Pleurotus ostreatus by quantitative analysis of the reaction outcome by pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectroscopy. The two laccases were equally efficient in catalyzing grafting, but only-N-OH type mediators grafted. HPI (N-hydroxyacetanilide) grafted 7-10 times better than HBT (1-hydroxybenzotriazole). Three different mechanisms are suggested to explain the grafting of HPI and HBT, all involving radical-radical coupling to produce covalent bonding to lignin. Lignin from exhaustive cellulase treatment of wheat straw was more susceptible to grafting than beech organosolv lignin with the relative abundance of grafting being 35% vs. 11% for HPI and 5% vs. 1% for HBT on these lignin substrates.

We employed electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR) for real time measurement of such catalytic radical formation activity on three types of lignin (two types of organosolv lignin, and a lignin rich residue from wheat straw hydrolysis) brought about by two different fungal laccases, derived from Trametes versicolor (Tv) and Myceliophthora thermophila (Mt), respectively. Laccase addition to suspensions of the individual lignin samples produced immediate time and enzyme dose dependent increases in intensity in the EPR signal with g-values in the range 2.0047–2.0050 allowing a direct quantitative monitoring of the radical formation and thus allowed laccase enzyme kinetics assessment on lignin. The experimental data verified that the laccases acted upon the insoluble lignin substrates in the suspensions. When the action on the lignin substrates of the two laccases were compared on equal enzyme dosage levels (by activity units on syringaldazine) the Mt laccase exerted a significantly faster radical formation than the Tv laccase on all three types of lignin substrates. When comparing the equal laccase dose rates on the three lignin substrates the enzymatic radical formation rate on the wheat straw lignin residue was consistently higher than those of the organosolv lignins. The pH-temperature optimum for the radical formation rate in organosolv lignin was determined by response surface methodology to pH 4.8, 33&nbsp;^\circC and pH 5.8, 33&nbsp;^\circC for the Tv laccase and the Mt laccase, respectively.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A Comprehensive Phenotypic Investigation of the “Pod-Shattering Syndrome” in Common Bean;,citation_abstract=Seed shattering in crops is a key domestication trait due to its relevance for seed dispersal, yield, and fundamental questions in evolution (e.g., convergent evolution). Here, we focused on pod shattering in common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), the most important legume crop for human consuption in the world. With this main aim, we developed a methodological pipeline that comprises a thorough characterization under field conditions, including also the chemical composition and histological analysis of the pod valves. The pipeline was developed based on the assumption that the shattering trait itself can be treated in principle as a “syndrome” (i.e., a set of correlated different traits) at the pod level. We characterized a population of 267 introgression lines that were developed ad-hoc to study shattering in common bean. Three main objectives were sought: (1) to dissect the shattering trait into its “components,” of level (percentage of shattering pods per plant) and mode (percentage of pods with twisting or non-twisting valves); (2) to test whether shattering is associated to the chemical composition and/or the histological characteristics of the pod valves; and (3) to test the associations between shattering and other plant traits. We can conclude the following: Very high shattering levels can be achieved in different modes; shattering resistance is mainly a qualitative trait; and high shattering levels is correlated with high carbon and lignin contents of the pod valves and with specific histological charaterstics of the ventral sheath and the inner fibrous layer of the pod wall. Our data also suggest that shattering comes with a “cost,” as it is associated with low pod size, low seed weight per pod, high pod weight, and low seed to pod-valves ratio; indeed, it can be more exaustively described as a syndrome at the pod level. Our work suggests that the valve chemical composition (i.e., carbon and lignin content) can be used for a high troughput phenotyping procedures for shattering phenotyping. Finally, we believe that the application of our pipeline will greatly facilitate comparative studies among legume crops, and gene tagging.;,citation_author=Maria L.

After insertion into the endoplasmic reticulum, KOR1 cycles between the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and the plasma membrane (PM). From the TGN, the protein is targeted to growing cell plates during cell division. These processes are governed by multiple sequence motifs and also host genotypes. Here, we investigated the interaction and hierarchy of known and newly identified sorting signals in KOR1 and how they affect KOR1 transport at various stages in the secretory pathway. Conventional steady-state localization showed that structurally compromised KOR1 variants were directed to tonoplasts. In addition, a tandem fluorescent timer technology allowed for differential visualization of young versus aged KOR1 proteins, enabling the analysis of single-pass transport through the secretory pathway. Observations suggest the presence of multiple checkpoints/branches during KOR1 trafficking, where the destination is determined based on KOR1’s sequence motifs and folding status. Moreover, growth analyses of dominant PM-confined KOR1-L48L49\rightarrowA48A49 variants revealed the importance of active removal of KOR1 from the PM during salt stress, which otherwise interfered with stress acclimation.;,citation_author=Yukihiro Nagashima;,citation_author=Zeyang Ma;,citation_author=Xueting Liu;,citation_author=Xiaoning Qian;,citation_author=Xiuren Zhang;,citation_author=Antje Schaewen;,citation_author=Hisashi Koiwa;,citation_publication_date=2020-02;,citation_cover_date=2020-02;,citation_year=2020;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1105/tpc.19.00714;,citation_issn=1040-4651;,citation_volume=32;,citation_journal_title=Plant Cell;">

The reduced epidermal fluorescence1 (ref1) mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana accumulates only 10 to 30% of the sinapate esters found in wild-type plants. Positional cloning of the REF1 gene revealed that it encodes an aldehyde dehydrogenase, a member of a large class of NADP+-dependent enzymes that catalyze the oxidation of aldehydes to their corresponding carboxylic acids. Consistent with this finding, extracts of ref1 leaves exhibit low sinapaldehyde dehydrogenase activity. These data indicate that REF1 encodes a sinapaldehyde dehydrogenase required for sinapic acid and sinapate ester biosynthesis. When expressed in Escherichia coli, REF1 was found to exhibit both sinapaldehyde and coniferaldehyde dehydrogenase activity, and further phenotypic analysis of ref1 mutant plants showed that they contain less cell wall–esterified ferulic acid. These findings suggest that both ferulic acid and sinapic acid are derived, at least in part, through oxidation of coniferaldehyde and sinapaldehyde.

This study was undertaken to clarify the influence of stem inclination on phloem fibres using several Japanese hardwood species that produce different G-fibre types in tension wood.\n\nMETHODS: Eight hardwood species were inclined at 30-45^\circ at the beginning of April. Specimens were collected in July and December. The cell-wall structure and lignin distribution of phloem fibres on both the tension and opposite sides were compared by light microscopy, ultraviolet microscopy, confocal laser scanning microscopy after staining with acriflavine, and transmission electron microscopy after staining with potassium permanganate.\n\nKEY RESULTS: Three types of changes were found in tension-side phloem fibres: (1) increases in the proportion of the syringyl unit in lignin in the S(1) and S(2) layers and compound middle lamella (Cercidiphyllum japonicum), (2) formation of unlignified gelatinous layers (Melia azedarach and Acer rufinerve) and (3) increases in the number of layers (n) in the multi-layered structure of S(1) + S(2) + n (G + L) (Mallotus japonicus). Other species showed no obvious change in cell-wall structure or lignin distribution.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Phloem fibres of the tree species examined in our study showed three types of changes in lignin distribution and cell-wall structure.

The peroxidase obtained from the latex, like wheat germ peroxidase 556, could catalyze active oxidation of coniferyl alcohol in the presence of hydrogen peroxide; the activity could be detected even with low concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and coniferyl alcohol. The formation of a lignin-like dehydrogenative polymerization product from coniferyl alcohol by the action of phenolase and peroxidase could be detected by measuring increases in turbidity and also by changes in absorption spectrum of the reaction mixtures. The formation of the polymerization product was much faster with per- oxidase than with phenolase.

The characteristic mechanical stiffness, chemical recalcitrance, and hydrophobic nature of SCWs result from the organization of SCW-specific biopolymers, i.e., highly ordered cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. Synthesis of these SCW-specific biopolymers requires SCW-specific enzymes that are regulated by SCW-specific transcription factors. In this review, we summarize our current knowledge of the transcriptional regulation of SCW formation in plant cells. Advances in research on SCW biosynthesis during the past decade have expanded our understanding of the transcriptional regulation of SCW formation, particularly the functions of the NAC and MYB transcription factors. Focusing on the NAC-MYB-based transcriptional network, we discuss the regulatory systems that evolved in land plants to modify the cell wall to serve as a key component of structures that conduct water and provide mechanical support.;,citation_author=Yoshimi Nakano;,citation_author=Masatoshi Yamaguchi;,citation_author=Hitoshi Endo;,citation_author=Nur Ardiyana Rejab;,citation_author=Misato Ohtani;,citation_publication_date=2015;,citation_cover_date=2015;,citation_year=2015;,citation_issn=1664-462X;,citation_volume=6;,citation_journal_title=Front.

This is achieved by degrading unmethylated and methylated wood by thioacidolysis and analyzing the resultant product mixtures by quantitative 31P NMR spectroscopy. Applying this new method to compression wood and normal wood from Pinus radiata showed that, whereas 41–47% of etherified guaiacyl C-9 units are condensed at the C5 position, almost all phenolic guaiacyl C-9 units exist as uncondensed moieties. Analysis of milled wood lignin (MWL) isolated from the same wood by 31P NMR spectroscopy before and after thioacidolysis showed that the phenolic guaiacyl C-9 units were more condensed than those in the in situ lignin. This is likely due to partial cleavage of the more condensed etherified linkages during the lignin isolation, leading to a relative increase in condensed phenolic guaiacyl C-9 units.;,citation_author=Bernadette Nanayakkara;,citation_author=Merilyn Manley-Harris;,citation_author=Ian D.

For example, IDRs provide efficient housing for large numbers of post-translational modification (PTM) sites in eukaryotic proteins. Here, we study the distribution of more than 15,000 experimentally determined human methylation, acetylation and ubiquitination sites (collectively termed “MAU” sites) in ordered and disordered regions, and analyse their conservation across 380 eukaryotic species. Conservation signals for the maintenance and novel emergence of MAU sites are examined at 11 evolutionary levels from the whole eukaryotic domain down to the ape superfamily, in both ordered and disordered regions. We discover that MAU PTM is a major driver of conservation for arginines and lysines in both ordered and disordered regions, across the 11 levels, most significantly across the mammalian clade. Conservation of human methylatable arginines is very strongly favoured for ordered regions rather than for disordered, whereas methylatable lysines are conserved in either set of regions, and conservation of acetylatable and ubiquitinatable lysines is favoured in disordered over ordered. Notably, we find evidence for the emergence of new lysine MAU sites in disordered regions of proteins in deuterostomes and mammals, and in ordered regions after the dawn of eutherians. For histones specifically, MAU sites demonstrate an idiosyncratic significant conservation pattern that is evident since the last common ancestor of mammals. Similarly, folding-on-binding (FB) regions are highly enriched for MAU sites relative to either ordered or disordered regions, with ubiquitination sites in FBs being highly conserved at all evolutionary levels back as far as mammals. This investigation clearly demonstrates the complex patterns of PTM evolution across the human proteome and that it is necessary to consider conservation of sequence features at multiple evolutionary levels in order not to get an incomplete or misleading picture.;,citation_author=Mohanalakshmi Narasumani;,citation_author=Paul M.

Their presence generates a paracellular barrier, analogous to animal tight junctions, that is thought to be crucial for selective nutrient uptake, exclusion of pathogens, and many other processes. Despite their importance, the chemical nature of Casparian strips has remained a matter of debate, confounding further molecular analysis. Suberin, lignin, lignin-like polymers, or both, have been claimed to make up Casparian strips. Here we show that, in Arabidopsis, suberin is produced much too late to take part in Casparian strip formation. In addition, we have generated plants devoid of any detectable suberin, which still establish functional Casparian strips. In contrast, manipulating lignin biosynthesis abrogates Casparian strip formation. Finally, monolignol feeding and lignin-specific chemical analysis indicates the presence of archetypal lignin in Casparian strips. Our findings establish the chemical nature of the primary root-diffusion barrier in Arabidopsis and enable a mechanistic dissection of the formation of Casparian strips, which are an independent way of generating tight junctions in eukaryotes.;,citation_author=S.

A major QTL on chromosome 9, Sub1, has provided the opportunity to apply marker assisted backcrossing (MAB) to develop submergence tolerant versions of rice cultivars that are widely grown in the region. In the present study, molecular markers that were tightly linked with Sub1, flanking Sub1, and unlinked to Sub1 were used to apply foreground, recombinant, and background selection, respectively, in backcrosses between a submergence-tolerant donor and the widely grown recurrent parent Swarna. By the BC(2)F(2) generation a submergence tolerant plant was identified that possessed Swarna type simple sequence repeat (SSR) alleles on all fragments analyzed except the tip segment of rice chromosome 9 that possessed the Sub1 locus. A BC(3)F(2) double recombinant plant was identified that was homozygous for all Swarna type alleles except for an approximately 2.3-3.4 Mb region surrounding the Sub1 locus. The results showed that the mega variety Swarna could be efficiently converted to a submergence tolerant variety in three backcross generations, involving a time of two to three years. Polymorphic markers for foreground and recombinant selection were identified for four other mega varieties to develop a wider range of submergence tolerant varieties to meet the needs of farmers in the flood-prone regions.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Manual Validation of Peptide Sequence and Sites of Tyrosine Phosphorylation from MS/MS Spectra;,citation_abstract=Mass spectrometry-based analysis of protein phosphorylation has become increasingly powerful over the past decade and has been applied to many different biological systems. One of the most significant concerns facing the phosphoproteomics community and the proteomics field as a whole is the quality and accuracy of the data generated in these large scale efforts. For protein identification in a given sample, the solution has been to require multiple peptides per protein, eliminating “one-hit-wonders” (proteins identified on the basis of a single peptide assignment) which may increase false positives in the data set. Unfortunately, most of the phosphoproteomics data fall into the latter category, as each phosphoryla-tion site will most likely be represented by a single tryptic peptide. Here we provide a detailed protocol describing our manual validation efforts to assure accurate peptide and phosphorylation site assignment for individual MS/MS spectra. In this procedure we use a combination of tools to assign b-, y-, neutral loss, and internal fragment ions, with the goal of assigning all significant ions in the MS/MS spectrum. Confident peptide and phosphorylation site assignment requires good coverage of the peptide with minimal unassigned fragment ions.

Stem segments were co-cultivated with a strain of Agrobacterium tumefaciens carrying a disarmed binary vector conferring resistance to kanamycin or hygromycin. The respective vectors also carried a fused bacterial luxF2 gene expressed from the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. All transformants had a normal phenotype. Genetic transformation and stable integration of the heterologous DNA was confirmed by Southern hybridization and luciferase expression. The latter was measured by destructive enzymatic assay throughout the transformant and by non-destructive image analysis in leaves left attached to intact plants. Both measurement techniques detected marked within- and between-organ variation in luciferase expression. However, the spatial patterns detected by each technique in the leaves were similar. The results indicate that in vivo imaging of light emission can be used to measure repeatedly the expression of a promoter-luciferase gene fusion in a particular leaf over an extended time period. It was also demonstrated that enzymatically assayed luciferase activity in leaves was notably lower in transgenic hybrid aspen plants than in tobacco plants transformed with the same vector. This was not due to a difference in luciferase enzyme activity between the two species, and therefore indicated that the 35S promoter is not as active in hybrid aspen as in tobacco.;,citation_author=Ove Nilsson;,citation_author=Torsten Aldén;,citation_author=Folke Sitbon;,citation_author=C.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Cloning and RNAi-mediated functional characterization of MaLac2 of the pine sawyer, Monochamus alternatus;,citation_abstract=Laccase, a member of a group of proteins collectively known as multicopper oxidases, is hypothesized to play an important role in insect cuticle sclerotization by oxidizing catechols in the cuticle to their corresponding quinones, which then catalyze protein cross-linking reactions. Laccase 2 has been proved as the gene required for beetle cuticle tanning through RNA interference (RNAi) experiments on red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum. The pine sawyer beetle, Monochamus alternatus (Coleoptero: Cerambycidae) is the insect serving as a major vector of the pinewood nematode, Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, which is the causative agent for pine wilt disease. The cDNA of MaLac2 was cloned from the insect in this study. The conceptual amino-acid sequence deduced was much conserved with other known insect laccases, particularly with the enzyme of Tribolium castaneum. Injection in hemolymph of pine sawyer larva of dsRNA targeting the laccase 2 mRNA leads to important alterations of the tanning, hardening and sclerotization of the pupal and adult cuticles. Defaults appear in a dose-dependent manner and high loads of dsRNA are lethal. The decrease of the endogenous laccase 2 mRNA affects the procuticle which is thinner and without the characteristic piling up of successive layers. The observations reinforce the role of laccase 2 as an essential phenoloxidase for making cuticle.;,citation_author=B. L. Niu;,citation_author=W. F. Shen;,citation_author=Y. Liu;,citation_author=H.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Designing cell walls for improved bioenergy production;,citation_abstract=Dwindling supply and unpredictable price fluctuations of fossil fuels has necessitated a renewed worldwide search for alternative fuels. Plant cell walls, rich in cellulose and hemicellulose, are actively pursued for their use in production of second-generation biofuels. It has been envisioned that degradation of these carbohydrate polymers to their sugar monomer subunits (saccharification) will provide necessary substrates for their yeast-mediated fermentation to ethanol. But the major component of plant cell walls, cellulose, is not easily amenable to this type of deconstruction and is tightly interlinked with hemicelluloses and lignin, making cell walls highly recalcitrant to saccharification. Thus, altering cell wall properties through manipulation of cell wall genes is one of the ways for improving saccharification of cell walls for bioethanol production. In recent years, efforts have been made via genetic engineering approaches for improving saccharification, yet we are still far away from replacing fossil fuels with biofuels. This review focuses on recent progress made in the alteration of cell wall properties through manipulation of native cell wall genes for enhanced saccharification and bioethanol production.;,citation_author=Akula Nookaraju;,citation_author=Shashank K.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Functional Specialization of Cellulose Synthase Isoforms in a Moss Shows Parallels with Seed Plants;,citation_abstract=The secondary cell walls of tracheary elements and fibers are rich in cellulose microfibrils that are helically oriented and laterally aggregated. Support cells within the leaf midribs of mosses deposit cellulose-rich secondary cell walls, but their biosynthesis and microfibril organization have not been examined. Although the Cellulose Synthase (CESA) gene families of mosses and seed plants diversified independently, CESA knockout analysis in the moss Physcomitrella patens revealed parallels with Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) in CESA functional specialization, with roles for both subfunctionalization and neofunctionalization. The similarities include regulatory uncoupling of the CESAs that synthesize primary and secondary cell walls, a requirement for two or more functionally distinct CESA isoforms for secondary cell wall synthesis, interchangeability of some primary and secondary CESAs, and some CESA redundancy. The cellulose-deficient midribs of ppcesa3/8 knockouts provided negative controls for the structural characterization of stereid secondary cell walls in wild type P. patens. Sum frequency generation spectra collected from midribs were consistent with cellulose microfibril aggregation, and polarization microscopy revealed helical microfibril orientation only in wild type leaves. Thus, stereid secondary walls are structurally distinct from primary cell walls, and they share structural characteristics with the secondary walls of tracheary elements and fibers. We propose a mechanism for the convergent evolution of secondary walls in which the deposition of aggregated and helically oriented microfibrils is coupled to rapid and highly localized cellulose synthesis enabled by regulatory uncoupling from primary wall synthesis.;,citation_author=Joanna H.

Softwood kraft lignin (KL) and two lignin polymer models (dehydrogenation polymers, DHPs) based on coniferyl alcohol (DHP c.alc. ) and coniferaldehyde (DHP c.ald. ) were in focus. The desorption force from the “silicon nitride SMFS tip” for the KL was significantly greater than that of the DHPs. The higher desorption force was interpreted as being due to the interaction of carboxyl groups through hydrogen bonding with the tip as well as to the less compact polymeric layer at the interface. The distribution of the extended chain lengths was determined, and self-association of lignin chains was observed. For both KL and the DHP c.ald. , chains were extended significantly beyond the limit that would be expected for polymers with the corresponding degree of polymerization. The \alpha-carbon on the DHP c.alc. has a strong intramolecular hydrogen bonding interaction with the adjacent aryl ether, which inhibits the possibility of the ether to participate in intermolecular hydrogen bonding with nearby lignin chains. Thus, the self-association for KL and DHP c.ald. was found to be dominated by intermolecular hydrogen bonding with carboxylic groups and aryl ether functionalities.;,citation_author=Shannon M.

By contrast to known LRR-RKs, which activate signaling upon ligand binding, PSY receptors (PSYRs) activate the expression of various genes encoding stress response transcription factors upon depletion of the ligands. Loss of PSYRs results in defects in plant tolerance to both biotic and abiotic stresses.

However, maintenance of these lines is laborious, involves routine subculturing and hampers wider use of transgenic lines, especially when many lines are required for a high-throughput functional genomics application. Cryopreservation of these lines may reduce the need for subculturing. Here, we established a simple protocol for cryopreservation of cell lines from five commonly used plant species, Arabidopsis thaliana, Daucus carota, Lotus japonicus, Nicotiana tabacum and Oryza sativa. The LSP solution (2 M glycerol, 0.4 M sucrose and 86.9 mM proline) protected cells from damage during freezing and was only mildly toxic to cells kept at room temperature for at least 2 h. More than 100 samples were processed for freezing simultaneously. Initially, we determined the conditions for cryopreservation using a programmable freezer; we then developed a modified simple protocol that did not require a programmable freezer. In the simple protocol, a thick expanded polystyrene (EPS) container containing the vials with the cell-LSP solution mixtures was kept at -30 ^\circC for 6 h to cool the cells slowly (pre-freezing); samples from the EPS containers were then plunged into liquid nitrogen before long-term storage. Transgenic Arabidopsis cells were subjected to cryopreservation, thawed and then re-grown in culture; transcriptome and metabolome analyses indicated that there was no significant difference in gene expression or metabolism between cryopreserved cells and control cells.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Arabidopsis VASCULAR-RELATED NAC-DOMAIN6 Directly Regulates the Genes That Govern Programmed Cell Death and Secondary Wall Formation during Xylem Differentiation;,citation_abstract=Xylem consists of three types of cells: tracheary elements (TEs), parenchyma cells, and fiber cells. TE differentiation includes two essential processes, programmed cell death (PCD) and secondary cell wall formation. These two processes are tightly coupled. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying these processes. Here, we show that VASCULAR-RELATED NAC-DOMAIN6 (VND6), a master regulator of TEs, regulates some of the downstream genes involved in these processes in a coordinated manner. We first identified genes that are expressed downstream of VND6 but not downstream of SECONDARY WALL-ASSOCIATED NAC DOMAIN PROTEIN1 (SND1), a master regulator of xylem fiber cells, using transformed suspension culture cells in microarray experiments. We found that VND6 and SND1 governed distinct aspects of xylem formation, whereas they regulated a number of genes in common, specifically those related to secondary cell wall formation. Genes involved in TE-specific PCD were upregulated only by VND6. Moreover, we revealed that VND6 directly regulated genes that harbor a TE-specific cis-element, TERE, in their promoters. Thus, we found that VND6 is a direct regulator of genes related to PCD as well as to secondary wall formation.;,citation_author=Kyoko Ohashi-Ito;,citation_author=Yoshihisa Oda;,citation_author=Hiroo Fukuda;,citation_publication_date=2010-10;,citation_cover_date=2010-10;,citation_year=2010;,citation_issue=10;,citation_doi=10.1105/tpc.110.075036;,citation_issn=1040-4651;,citation_volume=22;,citation_journal_title=Plant Cell;">

In situ hybridization using the basal part of wild-type seedlings clearly showed that expression of OsGS1;2 was detected in the phloem companion cells of the nodal vascular anastomoses and large vascular bundles of axillary buds. Accumulation of lignin, visualized using phloroglucin HCl, was also observed in these tissues. The lack of GS1;2 resulted in reduced accumulation of lignin. Re-introduction into the mutants of OsGS1;2 cDNA under the control of its own promoter successfully restored the outgrowth of tillers and lignin deposition to wild-type levels. Transcriptomic analysis using a 5 mm basal region of rice shoots showed that the GS1;2 mutants accumulated reduced amounts of mRNAs for carbon and nitrogen metabolism, including C1 unit transfer in lignin synthesis. Although a high content of strigolactone in rice roots is known to reduce active tiller number, the reduction of outgrowth of axillary buds observed in the GS1;2 mutants was independent of the level of strigolactone.

We identified two myb103 T-DNA insertion mutants and chemically characterized their lignocellulose by pyrolysis/GC/MS, 2D NMR, FT-IR microspectroscopy and wet chemistry. The mutants developed normally but exhibited a 70-75% decrease in syringyl (S) lignin. The level of guaiacyl (G) lignin was co-ordinately increased, so that total Klason lignin was not affected. The transcript abundance of FERULATE-5-HYDROXYLASE (F5H), the key gene in biosynthesis of S lignin, was strongly decreased in the myb103 mutants, and the metabolomes of the myb103 mutant and an F5H null mutant were very similar.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Primary Metabolism during Biosynthesis of Secondary Wall Polymers of Protoxylem Vessel Elements;,citation_abstract=Xylem vessels, the water-conducting cells in vascular plants, undergo characteristic secondary wall deposition and programmed cell death. These processes are regulated by the VASCULAR-RELATED NAC-DOMAIN (VND) transcription factors. Here, to identify changes in metabolism that occur during protoxylem vessel element differentiation, we subjected tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) BY-2 suspension culture cells carrying an inducible VND7 system to liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based wide-target metabolome analysis and transcriptome analysis. Time-course data for 128 metabolites showed dynamic changes in metabolites related to amino acid biosynthesis. The concentration of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, an important intermediate of the glycolysis pathway, immediately decreased in the initial stages of cell differentiation. As cell differentiation progressed, specific amino acids accumulated, including the shikimate-related amino acids and the translocatable nitrogen-rich amino acid arginine. Transcriptome data indicated that cell differentiation involved the active up-regulation of genes encoding the enzymes catalyzing fructose 6-phosphate biosynthesis from glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, phosphoenolpyruvate biosynthesis from oxaloacetate, and phenylalanine biosynthesis, which includes shikimate pathway enzymes. Concomitantly, active changes in the amount of fructose 6-phosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate were detected during cell differentiation. Taken together, our results show that protoxylem vessel element differentiation is associated with changes in primary metabolism, which could facilitate the production of polysaccharides and lignin monomers and, thus, promote the formation of the secondary cell wall. Also, these metabolic shifts correlate with the active transcriptional regulation of specific enzyme genes. Therefore, our observations indicate that primary metabolism is actively regulated during protoxylem vessel element differentiation to alter the cell’s metabolic activity for the biosynthesis of secondary wall polymers.;,citation_author=Misato Ohtani;,citation_author=Keiko Morisaki;,citation_author=Yuji Sawada;,citation_author=Ryosuke Sano;,citation_author=Abigail Loren Tung Uy;,citation_author=Atsushi Yamamoto;,citation_author=Tetsuya Kurata;,citation_author=Yoshimi Nakano;,citation_author=Shiro Suzuki;,citation_author=Mami Matsuda;,citation_author=Tomohisa Hasunuma;,citation_author=Masami Yokota Hirai;,citation_author=Taku Demura;,citation_publication_date=2016;,citation_cover_date=2016;,citation_year=2016;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1104/pp.16.01230;,citation_isbn=0000000224994;,citation_issn=0032-0889;,citation_pmid=27600813;,citation_volume=172;,citation_journal_title=Plant Physiol.;">

Transcript abundance of these genes can vary among genotypes and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) were identified in a recombinant population of the accessions Bay-0 and Shahdara. Genetic mapping and analysis of the transcript levels of CESAs between two distinct near isogenic lines (NILs) confirmed a change in CESA4 expression that segregates within that interval. We sequenced the promoters and identified 16 polymorphisms differentiating CESA4Sha and CESA4Bay. In order to determine which of these SNPs could be responsible for this eQTL, we screened for transcription factor protein affinity with promoter fragments of CESA4Bay, CESA4Sha, and the reference genome CESA4Col. The wall thickening activator proteins NAC SECONDARY WALL THICKENING PROMOTING FACTOR2 (NST2) and NST3 exhibited a decrease in binding with the CESA4Sha promoter with a tracheary element-regulating cis-element (TERE) polymorphism. While NILs harboring the TERE polymorphisms exhibited significantly different CESA4 expression, cellulose crystallinity and cell wall thickness were indistinguishable. These results suggest that the TERE polymorphism resulted in differential transcription factor binding and CESA4 expression; yet A. thaliana is able to tolerate this transcriptional variability without compromising the structural elements of the plant, providing insight into the elasticity of gene regulation as it pertains to cell wall biosynthesis and regulation.

However, it is highly perishable and susceptible to postharvest browning. In fresh fruit, browning is primarily caused by the polyphenol oxidase (PPO) enzyme catalyzing the oxidation of o-diphenols to quinones, which polymerize to form brown melanin pigment. There is no consensus in the literature regarding a specific role of PPO, and its subcellular localization in different plant species is mainly described within plastids. The present work determined the subcellular localization of a PPO protein from cherimoya (AcPPO). The obtained results revealed that the AcPPO- green fluorescent protein co-localized with a Golgi apparatus marker, and AcPPO activity was present in Golgi apparatus-enriched fractions. Likewise, transient expression assays revealed that AcPPO remained active in Golgi apparatus-enriched fractions obtained from tobacco leaves. These results suggest a putative function of AcPPO in the Golgi apparatus of cherimoya, providing new perspectives on PPO functionality in the secretory pathway, its effects on cherimoya physiology, and the evolution of this enzyme.;,citation_author=Patricio Olmedo;,citation_author=Adrián A.

We have synthesized lignin oligomers according to a new concept, in which peroxidase is never in direct contact with the lignin monomers coniferaldehyde and coniferyl alcohol. Instead, manganese oxalate worked as a diffusible redox shuttle, first being oxidized from Mn(II) to Mn(III) by a peroxidase and then being reduced to Mn(II) by a simultaneous oxidation of the lignin monomers to radicals that formed covalent linkages of the lignin type. Furthermore, a high molecular mass polymer was generated by oxidation of coniferyl alcohol by Mn(III) acetate in a dioxane and water mixture.

All known PPOs have been found to be localized in plastids, whereas flavonoid biosynthesis is thought to take place in the cytoplasm [or on the cytoplasmic surface of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)]. However, the primary structural characteristics of aureusidin synthase and some of its molecular properties argue against localization of the enzyme in plastids and the cytoplasm. In this study, the subcellular localization of the enzyme in petal cells of the yellow snapdragon was investigated. Sucrose-density gradient and differential centrifugation analyses suggested that the enzyme (the 39-kDa mature form) is not located in plastids or on the ER. Transient assays using a green fluorescent protein (GFP) chimera fused with the putative propeptide of the PPO precursor suggested that the enzyme was localized within the vacuole lumen. We also found that the necessary information for vacuolar targeting of the PPO was encoded within the 53-residue N-terminal sequence (NTPP), but not in the C-terminal sequence of the precursor. NTPP-mediated ER-to-Golgi trafficking to vacuoles was confirmed by means of the co-expression of an NTPP-GFP chimera with a dominant negative mutant of the Arabidopsis GTPase Sar1 or with a monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP)-fused Golgi marker (an H+-translocating inorganic pyrophosphatase of Arabidopsis). We identified a sequence-specific vacuolar sorting determinant in the NTPP of the precursor. We have demonstrated the biosynthesis of a flavonoid skeleton in vacuoles. The findings of this metabolic compartmentation may provide a strategy for overcoming the biochemical instability of the precursor chalcones in the cytoplasm, thus leading to the efficient accumulation of aurones in the flower.;,citation_author=Eiichiro Ono;,citation_author=Masayoshi Hatayama;,citation_author=Yuri Isono;,citation_author=Takuya Sato;,citation_author=Ryoko Watanabe;,citation_author=Keiko Yonekura-Sakakibara;,citation_author=Masako Fukuchi-Mizutani;,citation_author=Yoshikazu Tanaka;,citation_author=Takaaki Kusumi;,citation_author=Tokuzo Nishino;,citation_author=Toru Nakayama;,citation_publication_date=2006;,citation_cover_date=2006;,citation_year=2006;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1111/j.1365-313X.2005.02625.x;,citation_isbn=09607412;,citation_issn=09607412;,citation_pmid=16367960;,citation_volume=45;,citation_journal_title=Plant J.;">

This study demonstrates for the first time that oxygen as an essential electron acceptor is limiting in laccase mediated oxidation of lignin processes. Oxygen levels decreased to undetectable levels and remained undetectable for a long period in shaking samples without external oxygen supply. The decrease in fluorescence intensity attributed to the modification in conjugated carbonyl, biphenyl, phenylcoumarins and stilbene groups during laccase oxidationwas 40 times faster in sample mixtures supplied with pure oxygen than shaking samples without external oxygen supply and has direct implications on saving time. However, despite a general increase in molecular weight in all laccase treated lignins, pure oxygen supply does not always lead to the highest Mw. For example Mg-lignosulfonates treated with Trametes villosa laccase under shaking conditions without external oxygen supply had the highest Mw 85,777kDa as compared to 68,842kDa in the presence of pure oxygen.

The operation of a laccase-mediator system is firstly described in algae. Laccases (EC 1.10.3.2) catalyze the oxidation of a multitude of aromatic substrates. They are well known in higher plants and fungi, while their presence in green algae appears uncertain. Extracellular laccase-like enzyme activity has previously been described in culture supernatants of the green soil alga Tetracystis aeria [Otto et al. in Arch Microbiol 192:759-768, (2010)]. As reported herein, the T. aeria enzyme was purified 120-fold by employing a combination of anion exchange and size exclusion chromatography. The purified enzyme was confirmed to be a laccase according to its substrate specificity.

ABTS is by far the most efficient substrate. Two polypeptides, A (~110 kDa) and B (71 kDa), were co-purified by the applied procedure, both being highly N-glycosylated (\geq~53 and \geq27 %, respectively). As suggested by various gel electrophoretic analyses, the native enzyme (apparent molecular mass of ~220 kDa) most probably is a hetero-oligomer with the composition AB 2 , wherein A is the catalytic subunit and B forms a disulfide-linked homo-dimer B 2 . The decolorization of anthraquinone (Acid Blue 62 and Remazol Brilliant Blue R) and diazo dyes (Reactive Black 5) was studied in the presence of redox-mediating compounds (ABTS and syringaldehyde), demonstrating the operation of the laccase-mediator system in algae for the first time.

Oxidation of the classical laccase substrate ABTS was found to be widespread in chlorophycean algae. The oxidation activity detected in members of the “Scenedesmus” clade was caused by an unknown thermostable low-molecular-mass compound. In contrast, species of the Moewusinia, including Chlamydomonas moewusii and T. aeria, excreted putative “true” laccases. Phenolic substrates were oxidized by these enzymes optimally at neutral to alkaline pH. The Tetracystis laccase efficiently transformed bisphenol A, 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol, nonylphenol and triclosan in the presence of ABTS as redox mediator, while anthracene, veratrylalcohol and adlerol were not attacked. Lignosulfonate and humic acid underwent slight (de)polymerization reactions in the presence of the laccase and mediator(s), probably involving the oxidation of phenolic constituents. Possible natural functions of the enzymes, such as the synthesis of complex polymers or detoxification processes, may assist the survival of the algae in adverse environments.

Wall extension is thought to result from the loosening of its structure. However, it is not known how this is coordinated with wall synthesis. We have identified two novel allelic cellulose-deficient dwarf mutants, kobito1-1 and kobito1-2 (kob1-1 and kob1-2). The cellulose deficiency was confirmed by the direct observation of microfibrils in most recent wall layers of elongating root cells. In contrast to the wild type, which showed transversely oriented parallel microfibrils, kob1 microfibrils were randomized and occluded by a layer of pectic material. No such changes were observed in another dwarf mutant, pom1, suggesting that the cellulose defect in kob1 is not an indirect result of the reduced cell elongation. Interestingly, in the meristematic zone of kob1 roots, microfibrils appeared unaltered compared with the wild type, suggesting a role for KOB1 preferentially in rapidly elongating cells. KOB1 was cloned and encodes a novel, highly conserved, plant-specific protein that is plasma membrane bound, as shown with a green fluorescent protein–KOB1 fusion protein. KOB1 mRNA was present in all organs investigated, and its overexpression did not cause visible phenotypic changes.

However, the functional biology underlying this process is elusive. We subjected poplar trees to drought stress followed by a period of recovery. Water potential, hydraulic conductivity, gas exchange, xylem sap pH, and carbohydrate content in sap and woody stems were monitored in combination with an analysis of carbohydrate metabolism, enzyme activity, and expression of genes involved in sugar metabolic and transport pathways. Drought resulted in an alteration of differential partitioning between starch and soluble sugars. Upon stress, an increase in the starch degradation rate and the overexpression of sugar symporter genes promoted the efflux of disaccharides (mostly maltose and sucrose) to the apoplast. In turn, the efflux activity of the sugar-proton cotransporters caused a drop in xylem pH. The newly acidic environment induced the activity of apoplastic invertases leading to the accumulation of monosaccharides in the apoplast, thus providing the main osmoticum necessary for recovery. During drought and recovery, a complex network of coordinated molecular and biochemical signals was activated at the interface between xylem and parenchyma cells that appeared to prime the xylem for hydraulic recovery.;,citation_author=Chiara Pagliarani;,citation_author=Valentino Casolo;,citation_author=Maryam Ashofteh Beiragi;,citation_author=Silvia Cavalletto;,citation_author=Ilenia Siciliano;,citation_author=Andrea Schubert;,citation_author=Maria Lodovica Gullino;,citation_author=Maciej A.

Here, we describe detailed functional and structural analyses of CCRs from Medicago truncatula and Petunia hybrida and of an atypical CAD (CAD2) from M. truncatula. These enzymes are closely related members of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily. Our structural studies support a reaction mechanism involving a canonical SDR catalytic triad in both CCR and CAD2 and an important role for an auxiliary cysteine unique to CCR. Site-directed mutants of CAD2 (Phe226Ala and Tyr136Phe) that enlarge the phenolic binding site result in a 4- to 10-fold increase in activity with sinapaldehyde, which in comparison to the smaller coumaraldehyde and coniferaldehyde substrates is disfavored by wild-type CAD2. This finding demonstrates the potential exploitation of rationally engineered forms of CCR and CAD2 for the targeted modification of monolignol composition in transgenic plants. Thermal denaturation measurements and structural comparisons of various liganded and unliganded forms of CCR and CAD2 highlight substantial conformational flexibility of these SDR enzymes, which plays an important role in the establishment of catalytically productive complexes of the enzymes with their NADPH and phenolic substrates.;,citation_author=H.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Investigating Biochemical and Developmental Dependencies of Lignification with a Click-Compatible Monolignol Analog in Arabidopsis thaliana Stems;,citation_abstract=Lignin is a key structural component of plant cell walls that provides rigidity, strength, and resistance against microbial attacks. This hydrophobic polymer also serves a crucial role in water transport. Despite its abundance and essential functions, several aspects of lignin biosynthesis and deposition remain cryptic. Lignin precursors are known to be synthesized in the cytoplasm by complex biosynthetic pathways, after which they are transported to the apoplastic space, where they are polymerized via free radical coupling reactions into polymeric lignin. However, the lignin deposition process and the factors controlling it are unclear. In this study, the biochemical and developmental dependencies of lignification were investigated using a click-compatible monolignol analog, 3-O-propargylcaffeyl alcohol (3-OPC), which can incorporate into both in vitro polymerized lignin and Arabidopsis thaliana tissues. Fluorescence labeling of 3-OPC using click chemistry followed by confocal fluorescence microscopy enabled the detection and imaging of 3-OPC incorporation patterns. These patterns were consistent with endogenous lignification observed in different developmental stages of Arabidopsis stems. However, the concentration of supplied monolignols influenced where lignification occurred at the subcellular level, with low concentrations being deposited in cell corners and middle lamellae and high concentrations also being deposited in secondary walls. Experimental inhibition of multiple lignification factors confirmed that 3-OPC incorporation proceeds via a free radical coupling mechanism involving peroxidases/laccases and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Finally, the presence of peroxide-producing enzymes determined which cell walls lignified: adding exogenous peroxide and peroxidase caused cells that do not naturally lignify in Arabidopsis stems to lignify. In summary, 3-OPC accurately mimics natural lignification patterns in different developmental stages of Arabidopsis stems and allows for the dissection of key biochemical and enzymatic factors controlling lignification.;,citation_author=Jyotsna L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Medicago glucosyltransferase UGT72L1: Potential roles in proanthocyanidin biosynthesis;,citation_abstract=In the first reaction specific for proanthocyanidin (PA) biosynthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana and Medicago truncatula, anthocyanidin reductase (ANR) converts cyanidin to (-)-epicatechin. The glucosyltransferase UGT72L1 catalyzes formation of epicatechin 3\prime-O-glucoside (E3\primeOG), the preferred substrate for MATE transporters implicated in PA biosynthesis in both species. The mechanism of PA polymerization is still unclear, but may involve the laccase-like polyphenol oxidase TRANSPARENT TESTA 10 (TT10). We have employed a combination of cell biological, biochemical and genetic approaches to evaluate this PA pathway model. The promoter regions of UGT72L1 and MtANR share common cis-acting elements and direct overlapping, but partially distinct, expression patterns. UGT72L1 and MtANR are localized in the cytosol, whereas TT10 is localized to the vacuole. Over-expression of UGT72L1 in M. truncatula hairy roots results in increased accumulation of PA-like compounds, and loss of function of UGT72L1 partially reduces epicatechin, E3\primeOG and extractable PA levels in M. truncatula seeds. Expression of UGT72L1 in A. thaliana leads to a massive increase in E3\primeOG in immature seed, but reduced levels of extractable PAs. However, when UGT72L1 was expressed in the Arabidopsis tt10 mutant, extractable PA levels increased and seed coat browning was delayed.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The N-terminal zinc finger of CELLULOSE SYNTHASE6 is critical in defining its functional properties by determining the level of homodimerization in Arabidopsis;,citation_abstract=Primary cell wall cellulose is synthesized by the cellulose synthase complex (CSC) containing CELLULOSE SYNTHASE1 (CESA1), CESA3 and one of four CESA6-like proteins in Arabidopsis. It has been proposed that the CESA6-like proteins occupy the same position in the CSC, but their underlying selection mechanism remains unclear. We produced a chimeric CESA5 by replacing its N-terminal zinc finger with its CESA6 counterpart to investigate the consequences for its homodimerization, a crucial step in forming higher-order structures during assembly of the CSC. We found that the mutant phenotypes of prc1-1, a cesa6 null mutant, were rescued by the chimeric CESA5, and became comparable to the wild type (WT) and prc1-1 complemented by WT CESA6 in regard to plant growth, cellulose content, cellulose microfibril organization, CSC dynamics and subcellular localization. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays were employed to evaluate pairwise interactions between the N-terminal regions of CESA1, CESA3, CESA5, CESA6 and the chimeric CESA5. We verified that the chimeric CESA5 explicitly interacted with all the other CESA partners, comparable to CESA6, whereas interaction between CESA5 with itself was significantly weaker than that of all other CESA pairs. Our findings suggest that the homodimerization of CESA6 through its N-terminal zinc finger is critical in defining its functional properties, and possibly determines its intrinsic roles in facilitating higher-order structures in CSCs.;,citation_author=Sungjin Park;,citation_author=Shi-You Ding;,citation_publication_date=2020;,citation_cover_date=2020;,citation_year=2020;,citation_issue=5;,citation_doi=10.1111/tpj.14870;,citation_issn=1365-313X;,citation_volume=103;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Plant J.;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Two cell wall associated peroxidases from Arabidopsis influence root elongation;,citation_abstract=Two class III peroxidases from Arabidopsis, AtPrx33 and Atprx34, have been studied in this paper. Their encoding genes are mainly expressed in roots; AtPrx33 transcripts were also found in leaves and stems. Light activates the expression of both genes in seedlings. Transformed seedlings producing AtPrx33-GFP or AtPrx34-GFP fusion proteins under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter exhibit fluorescence in the cell walls of roots, showing that the two peroxidases are localized in the apoplast, which is in line with their affinity for the Ca(2+)-pectate structure. The role they can play in cell wall was investigated using (1) insertion mutants that have suppressed or reduced expression of AtPrx33 or AtPrx34 genes, respectively, (2) a double mutant with no AtPrx33 and a reduced level of Atprx34 transcripts, (3) a mutant overexpressing AtPrx34 under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter. The major phenotypic consequences of these genetic manipulations were observed on the variation of the length of seedling roots. Seedlings lacking AtPrx33 transcripts have shorter roots than the wild-type controls and roots are still shorter in the double mutant. Seedlings overexpressing AtPrx34 exhibit significantly longer roots. These modifications of root length are accompanied by corresponding changes of cell length.

Extensive searching within sequencing projects identified organisms containing sequences of this superfamily. Class I peroxidases, cytochrome c peroxidase (CcP), ascorbate peroxidase (APx), and catalase peroxidase (CP), are known to be present in bacteria, fungi, and plants, but have now been found in various protists. CcP sequences were detected in most mitochondria-possessing organisms except for green plants, which possess only ascorbate peroxidases. APx sequences had previously been observed only in green plants but were also found in chloroplastic protists, which acquired chloroplasts by secondary endosymbiosis. CP sequences that are known to be present in prokaryotes and in Ascomycetes were also detected in some Basidiomycetes and occasionally in some protists. Class II peroxidases are involved in lignin biodegradation and are found only in the Homobasidiomycetes. In fact class II peroxidases were identified in only three orders, although degenerate forms were found in different Pezizomycota orders. Class III peroxidases are specific for higher plants, and their evolution is thought to be related to the emergence of the land plants. We have found, however, that class III peroxidases are present in some green algae, which predate land colonization.

Herein, effects of modulating lignin monomeric compositions in a single plant species, Arabidopsis, are described. The earliest stage of putative &amp;amp;amp;quot;AcBr/Klason lignin&amp;quot; deposition was apparently unaffected by modulating p-coumarate 3-hydroxylase or ferulate 5-hydroxylase activities. This finding helps account for the inability of many other studies to fully suppress the reported putative levels of lignin deposition through monolignol biosynthesis manipulation, and also underscores limitations in frequently used lignin analytical protocols. The overall putative lignin content was greatly reduced (circa 62%) in a plant line harboring an H-(p-hydroxyphenyl) enriched lignin phenotype. This slightly increased H-monomer deposition level apparently occurred in cell-wall domains normally harboring guaiacyl (G) and/or syringyl (S) lignin moieties. For G- and S-enriched lignin phenotypes, the overall lignification process appeared analogous to wild type, with only xylem fiber and interfascicular fiber cells forming the S-enriched lignins. Laser microscope dissection of vascular bundles and interfascicular fibers, followed by pyrolysis GC/MS, supported these findings. Some cell types, presumably metaxylem and possibly protoxylem, also afforded small amounts of benzodioxane (sub)structures due to limited substrate degeneracy (i.e. utilizing 5-hydroxyconiferyl alcohol rather than sinapyl alcohol). For all plant lines studied, the 8-O-4[prime or minute] inter-unit frequency of cleavable H, G and/or S monomers was essentially invariant of monomeric composition for a given (putative) lignin content.

Using a transgenic approach, we investigated how reducing the extent of O-acetylation in xylan affects cell wall chemistry, plant performance and the recalcitrance of lignocellulose to saccharification. The Aspergillus niger acetyl xylan esterase AnAXE1 was expressed in Arabidopsis under the control of either the constitutively expressed 35S CAMV promoter or a woody-tissue-specific GT43B aspen promoter, and the protein was targeted to the apoplast by its native signal peptide, resulting in elevated acetyl esterase activity in soluble and wall-bound protein extracts and reduced xylan acetylation. No significant alterations in cell wall composition were observed in the transgenic lines, but their xylans were more easily digested by a \beta-1,4-endoxylanase, and more readily extracted by hot water, acids or alkali. Enzymatic saccharification of lignocellulose after hot water and alkali pretreatments produced up to 20% more reducing sugars in several lines. Fermentation by Trametes versicolor of tissue hydrolysates from the line with a 30% reduction in acetyl content yielded ~70% more ethanol compared with wild type. Plants expressing 35S:AnAXE1 and pGT43B:AnAXE1 developed normally and showed increased resistance to the biotrophic pathogen Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis, probably due to constitutive activation of defence pathways. However, unintended changes in xyloglucan and pectin acetylation were only observed in 35S:AnAXE1-expressing plants.

Three regions in the deduced amino acid sequences of the plant celA gene products are conserved with respect to the proteins encoded by bacterial celA genes. Within these conserved regions, there are four highly conserved subdomains previously suggested to be critical for catalysis and/or binding of the substrate UDP-glucose (UDP-Glc). An overexpressed DNA segment of the cotton celA1 gene encodes a polypeptide fragment that spans these domains and binds UDP-Glc, while a similar fragment having one of these domains deleted does not. The plant celA genes show little homology at the N- and C-terminal regions and also contain two internal insertions of sequence, one conserved and one hypervariable, that are not found in the bacterial gene sequences.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Control of Growth Symmetry Breaking in the Arabidopsis Hypocotyl;,citation_abstract=Complex shapes in biology depend on the ability of cells to shift from isotropic to anisotropic growth during development. In plants, this growth symmetry breaking reflects changes in the extensibility of the cell walls. The textbook view is that the direction of turgor-driven cell expansion depends on the cortical microtubule (CMT)-mediated orientation of cellulose microfibrils [1, 2]. Here, we show that this view is incomplete at best. We used atomic force microscopy (AFM) to study changes in cell-wall mechanics associated with growth symmetry breaking within the hypocotyl epidermis. We show that, first, growth symmetry breaking is preceded by an asymmetric loosening of longitudinal, as compared to transverse, anticlinal walls, in the absence of a change in CMT orientation. Second, this wall loosening is triggered by the selective de-methylesterification of cell-wall pectin in longitudinal walls, and, third, the resultant mechanical asymmetry is required for the growth symmetry breaking. Indeed, preventing or promoting pectin de-methylesterification, respectively, increased or decreased the stiffness of all the cell walls, but in both cases reduced the growth anisotropy. Finally, we show that the subsequent CMT reorientation contributes to the consolidation of the growth axis but is not required for the growth symmetry breaking. We conclude that growth symmetry breaking is controlled at a cellular scale by bipolar pectin de-methylesterification, rather than by the cellulose-dependent mechanical anisotropy of the cell walls themselves. Such a cell asymmetry-driven mechanism is comparable to that underlying tip growth in plants [3] but also anisotropic cell growth in animal cells [4].;,citation_author=Alexis Peaucelle;,citation_author=Raymond Wightman;,citation_author=Herman Höfte;,citation_publication_date=2015-06;,citation_cover_date=2015-06;,citation_year=2015;,citation_issue=13;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.cub.2015.05.022;,citation_issn=0960-9822;,citation_volume=25;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Curr.

In the cell wall, monomers move freely, until they encounter stationary oxidative enzymes that determine where the lignin polymer forms. However, it remains unclear how lignin monomers are trafficked from inside the cell to the cell wall. Although multiple lines of circumstantial evidence implicate transporters, additional possible mechanisms include the diffusion of monomers across lipid bilayers and the release of monolignol glucosides stored in vacuoles.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Dwarfism of high-monolignol Arabidopsis plants is rescued by ectopic LACCASE overexpression;,citation_abstract=Lignin is a key secondary cell wall chemical constituent, and is both a barrier to biomass utilization and a potential source of bioproducts. The Arabidopsis transcription factors MYB58 and MYB63 have been shown to upregulate gene expression of the general phenylpropanoid and monolignol biosynthetic pathways. The overexpression of these genes also results in dwarfism. The vascular integrity, soluble phenolic profiles, cell wall lignin, and transcriptomes associated with these MYB-overexpressing lines were characterized. Plants with high expression of MYB58 and MYB63 had increased ectopic lignin and the xylem vessels were regular and open, suggesting that the stunted growth is not associated with loss of vascular conductivity. MYB58 and MYB63 overexpression lines had characteristic soluble phenolic profiles with large amounts of monolignol glucosides and sinapoyl esters, but decreased flavonoids. Because loss of function lac4 lac17 mutants also accumulate monolignol glucosides, we hypothesized that LACCASE overexpression might decrease monolignol glucoside levels in the MYB-overexpressing plant lines. When laccases related to lignification (LAC4 or LAC17) were co-overexpressed with MYB63 or MYB58, the dwarf phenotype was rescued. Moreover, the overexpression of either LAC4 or LAC17 led to wild-type monolignol glucoside levels, as well as wild-type lignin levels in the rescued plants. Transcriptomes of the rescued double MYB63-OX/LAC17-OX overexpression lines showed elevated, but attenuated, expression of the MYB63 gene itself and the direct transcriptional targets of MYB63.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Monolignol export by diffusion down a polymerization-induced concentration gradient;,citation_abstract=Lignin, the second most abundant biopolymer, is a promising renewable energy source and chemical feedstock. A key element of lignin biosynthesis is unknown: how do lignin precursors (monolignols) get from inside the cell out to the cell wall where they are polymerized? Modeling indicates that monolignols can passively diffuse through lipid bilayers, but this has not been tested experimentally. We demonstrate significant monolignol diffusion occurs when laccases, which consume monolignols, are present on one side of the membrane. We hypothesize that lignin polymerization could deplete monomers in the wall, creating a concentration gradient driving monolignol diffusion. We developed a two-photon microscopy approach to visualize lignifying Arabidopsis thaliana root cells. Laccase mutants with reduced ability to form lignin polymer in the wall accumulated monolignols inside cells. In contrast, active transport inhibitors did not decrease lignin in the wall and scant intracellular phenolics were observed.

From one of these clones, a 333 bp sequence was used to identify further cDNA clones (including one which is close to full length) and a genomic clone. The coding sequences found were of two similar but not identical versions with differences at 36 out of 520 residues of deduced amino acid sequence.

The coding sequence of lcc1 is interrupted by 14 short introns. The lcc1 and lcc2 genes are not allelic as they do not segregate in uninucleate spores derived from a four-spored basidium.

SDS-PAGE analysis of extracellular laccase protein, purified from compost extract, showed a predominant band of 65 kDa molecular mass, together with lesser amounts of smaller polypeptides. The main polypeptide was purified electrophoretically. Amino acid sequence analysis of the N-terminal region of the main polypeptide was used to specify the sequence of a 15-residue chemically synthesized peptide (N-terminal peptide). Rabbit antibodies were raised against pure laccase, electrophoretically purified main polypeptide and the synthetic N-terminal peptide. Electrophoretically purified main polypeptide antibody was further purified by affinity chromatography on laccase-CNBr-Sepharose. Western blot analysis showed that the antigenic behaviour of laccase in compost extract, culture filtrate from malt-extract culture, and the purified enzyme from both sources, differed. The patterns of bands revealed are most simply explained by generation of (proteolytically) partially cleaved enzyme molecules in the culture medium, possibly combined with differences in extent of glycosylation. [35S]Methionine incorporation and immunoprecipitation were used to follow laccase synthesis in cultures grown on malt extract. After short-term labelling, a single polypeptide of 68 kDa apparent molecular mass was immunoprecipitated from both mycelial extracts and the culture medium. When poly(A)-containing RNA from malt-extract-grown mycelium was translated in vitro in rabbit reticulocyte lysate, a single polypeptide of about 57 kDa molecular mass was immunoprecipitated, consistent with the previously measured carbohydrate content of 15% for the pure enzyme. After treatment with N-glycanase, the polypeptide showed an increase in mobility during SDS-PAGE consistent with a reduction in molecular mass of about 5 kDa, indicating about equal amounts of N- and O-linked carbohydrate. C-terminal labelling of pure laccase was attempted by transpeptidation with carboxypeptidase Y.

We present herein a novel, liquid phase in situ RT-PCR (IS-RT-PCR) protocol using a combination of gene-specific fluorescent primers and spectral confocal microscopy to localize target RNA in epicotyl sections and xylogenic suspension cultures of Zinnia elegans. Potential sources of artefacts from fixation to gene detection were systematically eliminated using both fluorescent primers and nucleotides for 18S rRNA gene detection, resulting in a set of optimal parameters for IS-RT-PCR that may be readily adapted to any target gene. By judiciously choosing fluorescent primers with non-overlapping fluorochromes, we have shown that our technique is readily adapted to multiplex IS-RT-PCR, enabling the simultaneous localization of more than one gene within a complex tissue or heterogeneous cell population. A 6-carboxy-2’,4,4’,5’,7,7’-hexachlorofluorescein (6-HEX)-labelled primer and a tetrachloro-6-carboxy-fluorescein (TET)-labelled primer were designed for two marker genes associated with programmed cell death in tracheary elements (TEs): an endonuclease (Zen1) and a cysteine protease (ZcP4), respectively. An additional Cyan5 (Cy5)-labelled primer was used to monitor 18SrRNA expression. As expected, the 18S signal was constitutively expressed throughout epicotyls sections and living cells in xylogenic in vitro cultures, whereas Zen1 and ZcP4 were co-localized in forming TEs both in planta and in vitro. Analogous to clustering analysis of gene expression using microarrays to elucidate common metabolic pathways and developmental processes, this novel technique is perfectly adapted to gaining a better understanding of gene function via the coordinated expression of genes in specific cell types of complex tissues and cell populations.;,citation_author=Edouard Pesquet;,citation_author=Odile Barbier;,citation_author=Philippe Ranocha;,citation_author=Alain Jauneau;,citation_author=Deborah Goffner;,citation_publication_date=2004;,citation_cover_date=2004;,citation_year=2004;,citation_issue=6;,citation_doi=10.1111/j.1365-313X.2004.02170.x;,citation_isbn=0960-7412;,citation_issn=09607412;,citation_pmid=15341636;,citation_volume=39;,citation_journal_title=Plant J.;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Novel Markers of Xylogenesis in Zinnia Are Differentially Regulated by Auxin and Cytokinin;,citation_abstract=The characterization of in vitro xylogenic cultures of zinnia (Zinnia elegans) has led to major discoveries in the understanding of xylem formation in plants. We have constructed and characterized a subtractive library from zinnia cultures enriched in genes that are specifically expressed at the onset of secondary wall deposition and tracheary element (TE) programmed cell death. This Late Xylogenesis Library (LXL) consisted of 236 nonredundant cDNAs, 77% of which encoded novel sequences in comparison with the 17,622 expressed sequence tag sequences publicly available. cDNA arrays were constructed to examine dynamic global gene expression during the course of TE formation. As a first step in dissecting auxin and cytokinin signaling during TE differentiation, macroarrays were probed with cDNAs from cells cultured in different hormonal conditions. Fifty-one percent of the LXL genes were induced by either auxin or cytokinin individually, the large majority by auxin. To determine the potential involvement of these categories of genes in TE differentiation, multiplex in situ-reverse transcription-PCR was performed on cells for two genes encoding putative cell wall proteins: Gibberellin stimulated transcript-1, induced by auxin alone, and expansin 5, induced by cytokinin alone. All transcriptionally active TEs expressed both genes, indicating that, although these genes may not be considered as specific markers for TE differentiation per se, they are nevertheless an integral part of TE differentiation program. Among the non-TE population, four different gene expression-based cell types could be distinguished. Together, these results demonstrate the underlying complexity of hormonal perception and the existence of several different cell types in in vitro TE cell cultures.;,citation_author=Edouard Pesquet;,citation_author=Philippe Ranocha;,citation_author=Sylvain Legay;,citation_author=Catherine Digonnet;,citation_author=Odile Barbier;,citation_author=Magalie Pichon;,citation_author=Deborah Goffner;,citation_publication_date=2005;,citation_cover_date=2005;,citation_year=2005;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1104/pp.105.064337;,citation_isbn=0032-0889 (Print){\textbackslash}r0032-0889 (Linking);,citation_issn=0032-0889;,citation_pmid=16306148;,citation_volume=139;,citation_journal_title=Plant Physiol.;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Microtubule-Associated Protein AtMAP70-5 Regulates Secondary Wall Patterning in Arabidopsis Wood Cells;,citation_abstract=Xylem tracheary elements (TEs) form hollow, sap-conducting tubes kept open by thickened ribs of secondary cell wall that provide the major structural element in wood. These ribs are enriched with cellulose and lignin, molecules that utilize more atmospheric CO2 than any other biopolymer on Earth. The thickenings form characteristic patterns (e.g., spiral and pitted) that depend upon the bundling of underlying microtubules [1, 2]. To identify microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) involved in patterning microtubules, we optimized an in??vitro system for triggering single Arabidopsis cells to differentiate synchronously into TEs. From more than 200 microtubule-implicated proteins, AtMAP70-5 was the only MAP upregulated upon, and specific to, TE differentiation. It lines the borders of each microtubule bundle and forms C-shaped &amp;amp;amp;quot;spacers&amp;quot; between adjacent bundles. Manipulating levels of AtMAP70-5 and its binding partner AtMAP70-1 by overexpression or RNA interference (RNAi) silencing shifted the balance between the characteristic patterns. RNAi silencing produced stunted plants with disorganized vascular bundles. In culture, RNAi knockdown caused ribs of secondary cell wall, surrounded by microtubules, to invaginate and fall into the cytoplasm. These results suggest that AtMAP70-5 and AtMAP70-1 are essential for defining where secondary cell wall polymers are applied at the cell cortex in wood-forming cells. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Ethylene stimulates tracheary element differentiation in Zinnia elegans cell cultures.;,citation_abstract=The exact role of ethylene in xylogenesis remains unclear, but the Zinnia elegans cell culture system provides an excellent model with which to study its role during the differentiation of tracheary elements (TEs) in vitro. Here, we analysed ethylene homeostasis and function during Z. elegans TE differentiation using biochemical, molecular and pharmacological methods. Ethylene evolution was confined to specific stages of TE differentiation. It was found to peak at the time of TE maturation and to correlate with the activity of the ethylene biosynthetic 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) oxidase. The ethylene precursor ACC was exported and accumulated to high concentrations in the extracellular medium, which also displayed a high capacity to convert ACC into ethylene. The effects of adding inhibitors of the ethylene biosynthetic ACC synthase and ACC oxidase enzymes to the TE cultures demonstrated for the first time strict dependence of TE differentiation on ethylene biosynthesis and a stimulatory effect of ethylene on the rate of TE differentiation. In a whole-plant context, our results suggest that ethylene synthesis occurs in the apoplast of the xylem elements and that ethylene participates, in a paracrine manner, in the control of the cambial stem cell pool size during secondary xylem formation.;,citation_author=Edouard Pesquet;,citation_author=Hannele Tuominen;,citation_publication_date=2011;,citation_cover_date=2011;,citation_year=2011;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.2010.03600.x;,citation_isbn=1469-8137 (Electronic){\textbackslash}r0028-646X (Linking);,citation_issn=1469-8137;,citation_pmid=21219334;,citation_volume=190;,citation_journal_title=New Phytol.;">

In situ RT-PCR verified expression of the lignin monomer biosynthetic cinnamoyl CoA reductase and cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase in not only the lignifying TEs but also in the unlignified non-TE cells of Z. elegans TE cell cultures and in living, parenchymatic xylem cells that surround TEs in stems. These cells were also shown to have the capacity to synthesize and transport lignin monomers and reactive oxygen species to the cell walls of dead TEs. Differential gene expression analysis in Z. elegans TE cell cultures and concomitant functional analysis in Arabidopsis thaliana resulted in identification of several genes that were expressed in the non-TE cells and that affected lignin chemistry on the basis of pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis.

An acyltransferase, named p-coumaroyl-CoA:monolignol transferase (OsPMT), that could acylate monolignols with pCA in vitro was recently identified from rice. In planta, such monolignol-pCA conjugates become incorporated into lignin via oxidative radical coupling, thereby generating the observed pCA appendages; however p-coumarates also acylate arabinoxylans in grasses. To test the authenticity of PMT as a lignin biosynthetic pathway enzyme, we examined Brachypodium distachyon plants with altered BdPMT gene function. Using newly developed cell wall analytical methods, we determined that the transferase was involved specifically in monolignol acylation. A sodium azide-generated Bdpmt-1 missense mutant had no (&amp;amp;amp;lt;0.5%) residual pCA on lignin, and BdPMT RNAi plants had levels as low as 10% of wild-type, whereas the amounts of pCA acylating arabinosyl units on arabinoxylans in these PMT mutant plants remained unchanged. pCA acylation of lignin from BdPMT-overexpressing plants was found to be more than three-fold higher than that of wild-type, but again the level on arabinosyl units remained unchanged. Taken together, these data are consistent with a defined role for grass PMT genes in encoding BAHD (BEAT, AHCT, HCBT, and DAT) acyltransferases that specifically acylate monolignols with pCA and produce monolignol p-coumarate conjugates that are used for lignification in planta.;,citation_author=Deborah L.

The procedure covers the preparation of cell walls, together with gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based methods, for both the analysis of monosaccharides as their volatile alditol acetate derivatives and for methylation analysis to determine linkage positions between monosaccharide residues as their volatile partially methylated alditol acetate derivatives. Analysis time will vary depending on both the method used and the tissue type, and ranges from 2 d for a simple neutral sugar composition to 2 weeks for a carboxyl reduction/methylation linkage analysis.;,citation_author=Filomena A.

Cinnamic acid was also readily taken up by the tissues and was very markedly concentrated in the xylem thickenings; the labelling of thickenings also occurred in empty tracheids. In developing xylem cells, labelling of the cytoplasm indicated that both the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi bodies were associated with the wall incorporation. Vesicles probably derived from the Golgi bodies, were generally observed to aggregate in the cytoplasm near the bands of wall microtubules (even if secondary wall thickening had not commenced). Simple biochemical analyses showed that incorporation of cinnamic acid into amino acids and proteins was negligible, but some lignin oxidation products were heavily labelled.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Crystal structure of a laccase from the fungus Trametes versicolor at 1.90-Å resolution containing a full complement of coppers;,citation_abstract=Laccase is a polyphenol oxidase, which belongs to the family of blue multicopper oxidases. These enzymes catalyze the one-electron oxidation of four reducing-substrate molecules concomitant with the four-electron reduction of molecular oxygen to water. Laccases oxidize a broad range of substrates, preferably phenolic compounds. In the presence of mediators, fungal laccases exhibit an enlarged substrate range and are then able to oxidize compounds with a redox potential exceeding their own. Until now, only one crystal structure of a laccase in an inactive, type-2 copper-depleted form has been reported. We present here the first crystal structure of an active laccase containing a full complement of coppers, the complete polypeptide chain together with seven carbohydrate moieties. Despite the presence of all coppers in the new structure, the folds of the two laccases are quite similar. The coordination of the type-3 coppers, however, is distinctly different. The geometry of the trinuclear copper cluster in the Trametes versicolor laccase is similar to that found in the ascorbate oxidase and that of mammalian ceruloplasmin structures, suggesting a common reaction mechanism for the copper oxidation and the O(2) reduction. In contrast to most blue copper proteins, the type-1 copper in the T. versicolor laccase has no axial ligand and is only 3-fold coordinated. Previously, a modest elevation of the redox potential was attributed to the lack of an axial ligand.

Primary transformants exhibiting reduction in CCR activity were obtained and a good correlation was observed between the decrease in the steady state level of CCR mRNA and the level of CCR activity. Lignin content and composition were examined in the progeny of primary transformants down2010regulated for CCR activity and exhibiting one single T2010DNA integration locus. All CCR down2010regulated lines display common features, such as an orange brown coloration of the xylem cell walls, an increase in the syringyl over guaiacyl (S/G) ratio, and the presence of unusual cell wall bound phenolics. Moreover, the less severely depressed lines exhibited a normal phenotype and a very slight reduction of the thioacidolysis yield, which is an indication of the abundance of the 03B22010O20104 linkages in lignin. The new lignin profiles observed in these lines support a role for CCR down2010regulation in improving wood properties of forest trees used in the pulp industry. On the other hand, the line with the most severely depressed CCR activity exhibited a strong reduction in lignin content together with altered development (reduced size, abnormal morphology of the leaves, collapsed vessels).

Saplings of hybrid poplar were fertilized for 33 d with either high or adequate levels of ammonium nitrate. We observed enhanced radial growth, wider vessels and fibres and thinner fibre walls in the secondary xylem of high N relative to adequate N plants. These anatomical differences translated into altered hydraulic properties with xylem being more transport efficient but also more vulnerable to drought-induced cavitation in high N plants. The changes in xylem structure and function were associated with differences in gene expression as revealed by the transcriptome analysis of the developing xylem region. We found 388 genes differentially expressed (fold change 1.5, P-value \leq 0.05), including a number of genes putatively involved in nitrogen and carbohydrate metabolism and various aspects of xylem cell differentiation.

Recent xylem pressure-probe and z-tube experiments suggest that cavitation limits xylem pressures to above -0.5 MPa, despite the much more negative pressures predicted by the cohesion-tension theory and measured with the standard pressure-chamber method(4,5,9,10). Here we show, using centrifugal force to induce negative pressure between -0.5 and -3.5 MPa in intact stems, that xylem conduits remained water-filled and conductive to species-specific pressures ranging from -1.2 to below -3.5 MPa. Results were consistent when stems were air-dried or injected with air.

Even though extracellular ROS generation constitutes only a minor part of a cell’s total ROS level, this fraction is of extraordinary importance. In an active apoplastic ROS burst, it is mainly the respiratory burst oxidases and peroxidases that are engaged, and defects of these enzymes can affect plant development and stress responses. It must be highlighted that there are also other less well-known enzymatic or non-enzymatic ROS sources. There is a need for ROS detoxification in the apoplast, and almost all cellular antioxidants are present in this space, but the activity of antioxidant enzymes and the concentration of low-mass antioxidants is very low. The low antioxidant efficiency in the apoplast allows ROS to accumulate easily, which is a condition for ROS signaling.

These database search methods treat modifications as static attachments of a mass to particular position in the peptide sequence, but many modifications undergo fragmentation in tandem mass spectrometry experiments alongside, or instead of, the peptide backbone. While this fragmentation can confound traditional search methods, it also offers unique opportunities for improved searches that incorporate modification-specific fragment ions.

Cellulose microfibrils, which are synthesized by plasma membrane-localized cellulose synthase (CESA) complexes, are the primary load-bearing elements of plant cell walls [2]. Cell walls are dynamic structures that are regulated in part by cell wall integrity (CWI)-monitoring systems that feed back to modulate wall properties and the synthesis of new wall components [3]. Several receptor-like kinases have been implicated as sensors of CWI [3, 4, 5], including the FEI1/FEI2 receptor-like kinases [4]. Here, we characterize two genes encoding novel plant-specific plasma membrane proteins (SHOU4 and SHOU4L) that were identified in a suppressor screen of the cellulose-deficient fei1 fei2 mutant. shou4 shou4l double mutants display phenotypes consistent with elevated levels of cellulose, and elevated levels of non-crystalline cellulose are present in this mutant. Disruption of SHOU4 and SHOU4L increases the abundance of CESA proteins at the plasma membrane as a result of enhanced exocytosis. The SHOU4/4L N-terminal cytosolic domains directly interact with CESAs.

The main load-bearing component of plant cell walls is cellulose, and how plants regulate its biosynthesis during development and in response to various environmental perturbations is a central question in plant biology. Cellulose is synthesized by cellulose synthase (CESA) complexes (CSCs) that are assembled in the Golgi apparatus and then delivered to the plasma membrane (PM), where they actively synthesize cellulose. CSCs travel along cortical microtubule paths that define the orientation of synthesis of the cellulose microfibrils. CSCs recycle between the PM and various intracellular compartments, and this trafficking plays an important role in determining the level of cellulose synthesized. In this review, we summarize recent findings in CESA complex organization, CESA posttranslational modifications and trafficking, and other components that interact with CESAs.

Phloroglucinol reacted in ethanol-hydrochloric acid with coniferyl aldehyde, sinapyl aldehyde, vanillin, and syringaldehyde to yield either pink pigments (in the case of hydroxycinnamyl aldehydes) or red-brown pigments (in the case of hydroxybenzaldehydes). However, coniferyl alcohol, sinapyl alcohol, and highly condensed dehydrogenation polymers derived from these cinnamyl alcohols and aldehydes did not react with phloroglucinol in ethanol-hydrochloric acid. The differences in the reactivity of phloroglucinol with hydroxycinnamyl aldehydes and their dehydrogenation polymers may be explained by the fact that, in the latter, the unsubstituted (alpha,beta-unsaturated) cinnamaldehyde functional group, which is responsible for the dye reaction, is lost due to lateral chain cross-linking reactions involving the beta carbon. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and thioacidolysis analyses of phloroglucinol-positive lignifying plant cell walls belonging to the plant species Zinnia elegans L., Capsicum annuumvar. annuum, Populus albaL., and Pinus halepensisL. demonstrated the presence of 4- O-linked hydroxycinnamyl aldehyde end groups and 4- O-linked 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-benzaldehyde (vanillin) end groups in lignins. However, given the relatively low abundance of 4- O-linked vanillin in lignifying cell walls and the low extinction coefficient of its red-brown phloroglucinol adduct, it is unlikely that vanillin contributes to a great extent to the phloroglucinol-positive stain reaction. These results suggest that the phloroglucinol-HCl pink stain of lignifying xylem cell walls actually reveals the 4- O-linked hydroxycinnamyl aldehyde structures contained in lignins.

The aim of many such experiments is to compare the phenotype of different species or genotypes in a specific environment, or to study plant performance under a range of suboptimal conditions. Our paper aims to bring together the minimum knowledge necessary for a plant biologist to set up such experiments and apply the environmental conditions that are appropriate to answer the questions of interest. We first focus on the basic choices that have to be made with regard to the experimental setup (e.g. where are the plants grown; what rooting medium; what pot size). Second, we present practical considerations concerning the number of plants that have to be analysed considering the variability in plant material and the required precision. Third, we discuss eight of the most important environmental factors for plant growth (light quantity, light quality, CO2, nutrients, air humidity, water, temperature and salinity); what critical issues should be taken into account to ensure proper growth conditions in controlled environments and which specific aspects need attention if plants are challenged with a certain a-biotic stress factor.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Fingerprinting the substrate specificity of M1 and M17 aminopeptidases of human malaria, Plasmodium falciparum;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of human malaria, expresses two aminopeptidases, PfM1AAP and PfM17LAP, critical to generating a free amino acid pool used by the intraerythrocytic stage of the parasite for proteins synthesis, growth and development. These exopeptidases are potential targets for the development of a new class of anti-malaria drugs.\n\nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To define the substrate specificity of recombinant forms of these two malaria aminopeptidases we used a new library consisting of 61 fluorogenic substrates derived both from natural and unnatural amino acids. We obtained a detailed substrate fingerprint for recombinant forms of the enzymes revealing that PfM1AAP exhibits a very broad substrate tolerance, capable of efficiently hydrolyzing neutral and basic amino acids, while PfM17LAP has narrower substrate specificity and preferentially cleaves bulky, hydrophobic amino acids. The substrate library was also exploited to profile the activity of the native aminopeptidases in soluble cell lysates of P. falciparum malaria.\n\nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This data showed that PfM1AAP and PfM17LAP are responsible for majority of the aminopeptidase activity in these extracts. These studies provide specific substrate and mechanistic information important for understanding the function of these aminopeptidases and could be exploited in the design of new inhibitors to specifically target these for anti-malaria treatment.;,citation_author=Marcin Poreba;,citation_author=Sheena McGowan;,citation_author=Tina S.

A large set of associations (41% of all hits) occurred in candidate genes preselected for their suggested a priori involvement with secondary growth.

Accompanying molecular changes as a function of infection time and across different species, and their functional impact, are still poorly understood. Thus, the transcriptomes of tomato galls and laser capture microdissected (LCM) GCs over the course of parasitism were compared with those of Arabidopsis, and functional analysis of a repressed gene was performed. Microarray hybridization with RNA from galls and LCM GCs, infection-reproduction tests and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) transcriptional profiles in susceptible and resistant (Mi-1) lines were performed in tomato. Tomato GC-induced genes include some possibly contributing to the epigenetic control of GC identity. GC-repressed genes are conserved between tomato and Arabidopsis, notably those involved in lignin deposition. However, genes related to the regulation of gene expression diverge, suggesting that diverse transcriptional regulators mediate common responses leading to GC formation in different plant species. TPX1, a cell wall peroxidase specifically involved in lignification, was strongly repressed in GCs/galls, but induced in a nearly isogenic Mi-1 resistant line on nematode infection. TPX1 overexpression in susceptible plants hindered nematode reproduction and GC expansion.

Seed coat browning is caused by the oxidation of flavonoids, particularly proanthocyanidins, which are polymers of flavan-3-ol subunits such as epicatechin and catechin. The tt10 mutant seeds accumulate more epicatechin monomers and more soluble proanthocyanidins than wild-type seeds. Moreover, intact testa cells of tt10 cannot trigger H2O2-independent browning in the presence of epicatechin and catechin, in contrast with wild-type cells. UV-visible light detection and mass spectrometry revealed that the major oxidation products obtained with epicatechin alone are yellow dimers called dehydrodiepicatechin A. These products differ from proanthocyanidins in the nature and position of their interflavan linkages. Flavonol composition was also affected in tt10 seeds, which exhibited a higher ratio of quercetin rhamnoside monomers versus dimers than wild-type seeds. We identified the TT10 gene by a candidate gene approach. TT10 encodes a protein with strong similarity to laccase-like polyphenol oxidases. It is expressed essentially in developing testa, where it colocalizes with the flavonoid end products proanthocyanidins and flavonols. Together, these data establish that TT10 is involved in the oxidative polymerization of flavonoids and functions as a laccase-type flavonoid oxidase. © 2005 American Society of Plant Biologists.;,citation_author=Lucille Pourcel;,citation_author=J M Routaboul;,citation_author=L Kerhoas;,citation_author=M Caboche;,citation_author=L Lepiniec;,citation_author=I Debeaujon;,citation_publication_date=2005;,citation_cover_date=2005;,citation_year=2005;,citation_issue=11;,citation_doi=10.1105/tpc.105.035154.1;,citation_isbn=1040-4651 (Print){\textbackslash}r1040-4651 (Linking);,citation_issn=1040-4651;,citation_pmid=16243908;,citation_volume=17;,citation_journal_title=Plant Cell;">

The main plant polymers responsible of water repelling are lipids and lignin, which play also important roles in the protection against biotic/abiotic stresses, regulation of flux of gases and solutes, and mechanical stability against negative pressure, among others. While the lipids, non-polymerized cuticular waxes together with the polymerized cutin, protect the outer surface, lignin is confined to the secondary cell wall within mechanical important tissues. In the present work a micro cross-section of the stem of Arabidopsis thaliana was used to track in situ the distribution of these non-carbohydrate polymers by Confocal Raman Microscopy. Raman hyperspectral imaging gives a molecular fingerprint of the native waterproofing tissues and cells with diffraction limited spatial resolution (~300 nm) at relatively high speed and without any tedious sample preparation. Lipids and lignified tissues as well as their effect on water content was directly visualized by integrating the 1299, 1600, and 3400 cm(-1) band, respectively.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Globally optimal stitching of tiled 3D microscopic image acquisitions;,citation_abstract=Motivation: Modern anatomical and developmental studies often require high-resolution imaging of large specimens in three dimensions (3D). Confocal microscopy produces high-resolution 3D images, but is limited by a relatively small field of view compared with the size of large biological specimens. Therefore, motorized stages that move the sample are used to create a tiled scan of the whole specimen. The physical coordinates provided by the microscope stage are not precise enough to allow direct reconstruction (Stitching) of the whole image from individual image stacks.Results: To optimally stitch a large collection of 3D confocal images, we developed a method that, based on the Fourier Shift Theorem, computes all possible translations between pairs of 3D images, yielding the best overlap in terms of the cross-correlation measure and subsequently finds the globally optimal configuration of the whole group of 3D images. This method avoids the propagation of errors by consecutive registration steps. Additionally, to compensate the brightness differences between tiles, we apply a smooth, non-linear intensity transition between the overlapping images. Our stitching approach is fast, works on 2D and 3D images, and for small image sets does not require prior knowledge about the tile configuration.Availability: The implementation of this method is available as an ImageJ plugin distributed as a part of the Fiji project (FijiisjustImageJ: http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/).Contact:tomancak@mpi-cbg.de;,citation_author=Stephan Preibisch;,citation_author=Stephan Saalfeld;,citation_author=Pavel Tomancak;,citation_publication_date=2009-06;,citation_cover_date=2009-06;,citation_year=2009;,citation_issue=11;,citation_doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btp184;,citation_issn=1367-4803;,citation_volume=25;,citation_journal_title=Bioinformatics;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A single heterologously expressed plant cellulose synthase isoform is sufficient for cellulose microfibril formation in vitro;,citation_abstract=Cellulose is an abundant natural polymer synthesized primarily by vascular plants in which it forms the load-bearing component of the cell wall. It is a linear polymer of glucose molecules synthesized by membrane-embedded cellulose synthases that couple polymer synthesis with its secretion across the plasma membrane. Plants express multiple cellulose synthase isoforms that are organized into large macromolecular assemblies of varying composition that are likely responsible for aligning the cellulose strands into microfibrils. Here we show that recombinantly expressed and purified Populus tremula x tremuloides (hybrid aspen) cellulose synthase-8 is sufficient for cellulose biosynthesis and produces cellulose microfibrils in vitro. Our results demonstrate that no other plant-derived factors are required for cellulose microfibril biosynthesis., Plant cell walls are a composite material of polysaccharides, proteins, and other noncarbohydrate polymers. In the majority of plant tissues, the most abundant polysaccharide is cellulose, a linear polymer of glucose molecules. As the load-bearing component of the cell wall, individual cellulose chains are frequently bundled into micro and macrofibrils and are wrapped around the cell. Cellulose is synthesized by membrane-integrated and processive glycosyltransferases that polymerize UDP-activated glucose and secrete the nascent polymer through a channel formed by their own transmembrane regions. Plants express several different cellulose synthase isoforms during primary and secondary cell wall formation; however, so far, none has been functionally reconstituted in vitro for detailed biochemical analyses. Here we report the heterologous expression, purification, and functional reconstitution of Populus tremula x tremuloides CesA8 (PttCesA8), implicated in secondary cell wall formation. The recombinant enzyme polymerizes UDP-activated glucose to cellulose, as determined by enzyme degradation, permethylation glycosyl linkage analysis, electron microscopy, and mutagenesis studies. Catalytic activity is dependent on the presence of a lipid bilayer environment and divalent manganese cations. Further, electron microscopy analyses reveal that PttCesA8 produces cellulose fibers several micrometers long that occasionally are capped by globular particles, likely representing PttCesA8 complexes. Deletion of the enzyme’s N-terminal RING-finger domain almost completely abolishes fiber formation but not cellulose biosynthetic activity. Our results demonstrate that reconstituted PttCesA8 is not only sufficient for cellulose biosynthesis in vitro but also suffices to bundle individual glucan chains into cellulose microfibrils.;,citation_author=Pallinti Purushotham;,citation_author=Sung Hyun Cho;,citation_author=Sara M.

To understand the orchestrated regulation of differentiation of TEs, we investigated the regulatory mechanism of gene expression directing TE differentiation. Detailed loss-of-function and gain-of-function analyses of the ZCP4 (Zinniacysteine protease 4) promoter, which confers TE-specific expression, demonstrated that a novel 11-bp cis-element is necessary and sufficient for the immature TE-specific promoter activity. The 11-bp cis-element-like sequences were found in promoters of many Arabidopsis TE differentiation-related genes. A gain-of-function analysis with similar putative cis-elements from secondary wall formation or modification-related genes as well as PCD-related genes indicated that the cis-elements are also sufficient for TE-specific expression of genes.

Methods: Commercial D-dimer assays, evaluated according to predetermined cutoff levels for each assay, specific for age (lower in subjects &amp;amp;amp;lt;70 years) and gender (lower in males), were used in the recent DULCIS study. The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged \geq60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event.

The organic remains preserved in the chromosomes and cell nuclei show marked structural heterogeneities compared to the cell walls during different stages of the cell cycle. The fossil and extant fern have similar \delta13C values obtained from bulk samples, supporting evolutionary stasis in this plant lineage and an unchanged metabolic pathway of carbon assimilation since the Jurassic. The organic remains in the cellular organelles of the fossil seem to be less heterogeneous than those in the extant fern, likely due to the preferential preservation of certain cellular compounds during fossilization.

Here, we used atomic force microscopy (AFM) stiffness tomography to explore stiffness distribution in the cell wall of suspension-cultured Arabidopsis thaliana as a model of primary, growing cell wall. For the first time that we know of, this new imaging technique was performed on living single cells of a higher plant, permitting monitoring of the stiffness distribution in cell-wall layers as a function of the depth and its evolution during the different growth phases. The mechanical measurements were correlated with changes in the composition of the cell wall, which were revealed by Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. In the beginning and end of cell growth, the average stiffness of the cell wall was low and the wall was mechanically homogenous, whereas in the exponential growth phase, the average wall stiffness increased, with increasing heterogeneity.

By combining evolutionary analysis of these 10 gene families with in silico promoter analysis and expression data (from a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis on an extensive tissue panel, mining of expressed sequence tags from publicly available resources, and assembling expression data from literature), 12 genes could be pinpointed as the most likely candidates for a role in vascular lignification. Furthermore, a possible novel link was detected between the presence of the AC regulatory promoter element and the biosynthesis of G lignin during vascular development.

Despite the sorghum crop importance in biofuel and fodder industry, there is no comprehensive information available on the cell wall related genes and gene families (biosynthetic and modification). It is important to identify the cell wall related genes to understand the cell wall biosynthetic process as well as to facilitate biomass manipulation. Genome-wide analysis using gene family specific Hidden Markov Model of conserved domains identified 520 genes distributed among 20 gene families related to biosynthesis/modification of various cell wall polymers such as cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin, and lignin. Chromosomal localization analysis of these genes revealed that about 65% of cell wall related genes were confined to four chromosomes (Chr. 1-4). Further, 56 tandem duplication events involving 169 genes were identified in these gene families which could be associated with expansion of genes within families in sorghum. Additionally, we also identified 137 Simple Sequence Repeats related to 112 genes and target sites for 10 miRNAs in some important families such as cellulose synthase, cellulose synthase-like, and laccases, etc. To gain further insight into potential functional roles, expression analysis of these gene families was performed using publically available data sets in various tissues and under abiotic stress conditions.

Observation, in the HMBC spectrum, of products of ferulate at its 8-position coupling with hydroxycinnamyl alcohols at the /3-position (producing 8-/3’-linked structures) is proof that ferulate-lignin radical cross-coupling reactions occur in vivo. Correlations of H-a’ (hydroxycinnamyl alcohol moiety) with guaiacyl and syringyl 1-, 2-, and 6-aromatic carbons in 8-/3’ structures indicates that ferulates couple with both coniferyl and sinapyl alcohol monomers. As notable as the presence of this and other ferulate products is the absence of coupling of ferulate at its 8-position with the 5- and O-4-positions of lignin units. Such structures were significant when ferulate was biomimetically incorporated into a synthetic lignin. Since hydroxycinnamyl alcohols couple almost exclusively at their/3-position in cross-coupling reactions, the 8-5’ and 8-0-4’ structures would only be formed by coupling with higher lignin oligomers (with no side-chain conjugation).

CCR converts activated cinnamic acids (hydroxycinnamoyl-SCoAs) to cinnamaldehydes; cinnamaldehydes are then reduced to cinnamyl alcohols by CAD. The transformations caused the incorporation of nontraditional components into the extractable tobacco lignins, as evidenced by NMR. Isolated lignin of antisense-CAD tobacco contained fewer coniferyl and sinapyl alcohol-derived units that were compensated for by elevated levels of benzaldehydes and cinnamaldehydes. Products from radical coupling of cinnamaldehydes, particularly sinapaldehyde, which were barely discernible in normal tobacco, were major components of the antisense-CAD tobacco lignin. Lignin content was reduced in antisense-CCR tobacco, which displayed a markedly reduced vigor. That lignin contained fewer coniferyl alcohol-derived units and significant levels of tyramine ferulate. Tyramine ferulate is a sink for the anticipated build-up of feruloyl-SCoA, and may be up-regulated in response to a deficit of coniferyl alcohol.

Two approaches were used. First, DFRC (derivatization followed by reductive cleavage) dimers derived from beta-5- and beta-beta-units in pine lignins, which certainly retain unaltered chiral centers (as well as beta-1- and beta-O-4-units where the intactness may be debated), were shown to be optically inactive by circular dichroism (CD) and chiral high-performance liquid chromatography. CD of beta-5-derived dimers following enantiomeric separation readily demonstrated the sensitivity of the method. Second, no optical activity could be detected (above 250 nm to avoid carbohydrate contributions) by CD of lignin isolates from pine, kenaf, maize, or a CAD-deficient pine mutant.

When enzymes late in the pathway are downregulated, significant changes in the composition and structure of lignin may result. NMR spectroscopy provides powerful diagnostic tools for elucidating structures in the difficult lignin polymer, hinting at the chemical and biochemical changes that have occurred. COMT (caffeic acid O-methyl transferase) downregulation in poplar results in the incorporation of 5-hydroxyconiferyl alcohol into lignins via typical radical coupling reactions, but post-coupling quinone methide internal trapping reactions produce novel benzodioxane units in the lignin. CAD (cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase) downregulation results in the incorporation of the hydroxycinnamyl aldehyde monolignol precursors intimately into the polymer. Sinapyl aldehyde cross-couples 8-O-4 with both guaiacyl and syringyl units in the growing polymer, whereas coniferyl aldehyde cross-couples 8-O-4 only with syringyl units, reflecting simple chemical cross-coupling propensities. The incorporation of hydroxycinnamyl aldehyde and 5-hydroxyconiferyl alcohol monomers indicates that these monolignol intermediates are secreted to the cell wall for lignification. The recognition that novel units can incorporate into lignins portends significantly expanded opportunities for engineering the composition and consequent properties of lignin for improved utilization of valuable plant resources. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.;,citation_author=John Ralph;,citation_author=Catherine Lapierre;,citation_author=Jane M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Lignins: Natural polymers from oxidative coupling of 4-hydroxyphenyl-propanoids;,citation_abstract=Lignins are complex natural polymers resulting from oxidative coupling of, primarily, 4-hydroxyphenylpropanoids. An understanding of their nature is evolving as a result of detailed structural studies, recently aided by the availability of lignin-biosynthetic-pathway mutants and transgenics. The currently accepted theory is that the lignin polymer is formed by combinatorial-like phenolic coupling reactions, via radicals generated by peroxidase-H2O2, under simple chemical control where monolignols react endwise with the growing polymer. As a result, the actual structure of the lignin macromolecule is not absolutely defined or determined. The “randomness” of linkage generation (which is not truly statistically random but governed, as is any chemical reaction, by the supply of reactants, the matrix, etc.) and the astronomical number of possible isomers of even a simple polymer structure, suggest a low probability of two lignin macromolecules being identical. A recent challenge to the currently accepted theory of chemically controlled lignification, attempting to bring lignin into line with more organized biopolymers such as proteins, is logically inconsistent with the most basic details of lignin structure. Lignins may derive in part from monomers and conjugates other than the three primary monolignols (p-coumaryl, coniferyl, and sinapyl alcohols). The plasticity of the combinatorial polymerization reactions allows monomer substitution and significant variations in final structure which, in many cases, the plant appears to tolerate. As such, lignification is seen as a marvelously evolved process allowing plants considerable flexibility in dealing with various environmental stresses, and conferring on them a striking ability to remain viable even when humans or nature alter “required” lignin-biosynthetic-pathway genes/enzymes. The malleability offers significant opportunities to engineer the structures of lignins beyond the limits explored to date.;,citation_author=John Ralph;,citation_author=Knut Lundquist;,citation_author=Gösta Brunow;,citation_author=Fachuang Lu;,citation_author=Hoon Kim;,citation_author=Paul F.

Polysaccharide-polysaccharide cross-linking in grasses is achieved by dehydrodimerization of hydroxycinnamate-polysaccharide esters; a complex array of hydroxycinnamic acid dehydrodimers are released by saponification. Ferulates are the major cross-linking agents, but sinapate-ferulate cross-products have been discovered implicating sinapates in a similar role. New dehydrodimers have been authenticated, expanding our knowledge of the chemistry, role, and extent of cross-linking reactions. Ferulate dehydrotrimers have been discovered; whether these trimers truly cross-link three independent polysaccharide chains or only two remains to be determined. Hydroxycinnamates and their dehydrodimers also undergo radical coupling reactions with lignin monomers and possibly oligomers, resulting in lignin-polysaccharide cross-linking in the wall. Both polysaccharide-polysaccharide and lignin-polysaccharide cross-links inhibit the enzymatic hydrolysis of cell walls. The cross-linking process has particular relevance to plant physiology, human and animal nutrition and health, and food technology.Abbreviations: CW – cell wall; DFA – dehydrodiferulic acid (or dehydrodiferulate in context); DSA – dehydrodisinapic acid; TFA – dehydrotriferulic acid; SA – sinapic acid (1S); TA – thomasidioic acid (5C3SS); IDF – insoluble dietary fiber; SDF – soluble dietary fiber; GC-MS – gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; NMR – nuclear magnetic resonance (spectroscopy).;,citation_author=John Ralph;,citation_author=Mirko Bunzel;,citation_author=Jane M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Lignins and lignification;,citation_abstract=As ever more component monomers are discovered, lignin can no longer be regarded as deriving from just the three canonical monolignols. Pathway intermediates such as the hydroxycinnamaldehydes and their derived hydroxybenzaldehydes, and additional products of truncated biosynthesis such as caffeyl and 5-hydroxyconiferyl alcohols, are now established lignin monomers. The array of acylated monolignols continues to expand with evidence for monolignol benzoates, vanillates, and ferulates that complement the accepted monolignol acetates, p -hydroxybenzoates, and p -coumarates. Game-changing findings have demonstrated that phenolics from alternative pathways, including flavonoids and hydroxystilbenes, are also involved in lignification, expanding the traditional concept. Beyond the basic science intrigue, these findings propound exciting new avenues for valorizing lignins, or for producing more readily extractable/depolymerizable lignins, in crop and bioenergy plants.

This developmental plasticity is apparent not only in root and shoot growth rates, but also in tissue patterning and cell morphology.1,2 We have previously shown that in response to limited water availability, Arabidopsis thaliana root displays changes in xylem morphology, mediated by the non-cell-autonomous action of abscisic acid, ABA.2 Here, we show, through analyses of ABA response reporters and tissue-specific suppression of ABA signaling, that xylem cells themselves act as primary signaling centers governing both xylem cell fate and xylem differentiation rate, revealing the cell-autonomous control of multiple aspects of xylem development by ABA. ABA rapidly activates the expression of genes encoding VASCULAR-RELATED NAC DOMAIN (VND) transcription factors. Molecular and genetic analyses revealed that the two ABA-mediated xylem developmental changes are regulated by distinct members of this transcription factor family, with VND2 and VND3 promoting differentiation rate of metaxylem cells, while VND7 promotes the conversion of metaxylem toward protoxylem morphology. This phenomenon shows how different aspects of developmental plasticity can be interlinked, yet genetically separable. Moreover, similarities in phenotypic and molecular responses to ABA in diverse species indicate evolutionary conservation of the ABA-xylem development regulatory network among eudicots. Hence, this study gives molecular insights into how environmental stress modifies plant vascular anatomy and has potential relevance for water use optimization and adaptation to drought conditions.;,citation_author=Prashanth Ramachandran;,citation_author=Frauke Augstein;,citation_author=Shamik Mazumdar;,citation_author=Thanh Van Nguyen;,citation_author=Elena A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Tyrosinase: The four oxidation states of the active site and their relevance to enzymatic activation, oxidation and inactivation;,citation_abstract=Tyrosinase is an enzyme widely distributed in the biosphere. It is one of a group of proteins with a strongly conserved bicopper active centre able to bind molecular oxygen. Tyrosinase manifests two catalytic properties; monooxygenase and oxidase activity. These actions reflect the oxidation states of the active centre. Tyrosinase has four possible oxidation states and the details of their interaction are shown to give rise to the unusual kinetic behaviour of the enzyme. The resting state of the enzyme is met-tyrosinase [Cu(II)2] and activation, associated with a ’lag period’, involves reduction to deoxy-tyrosinase [Cu(I)2] which is capable of binding dioxygen to form oxy-tyrosinase [Cu(II)2\cdotO2]. Initially the conversion of met- to deoxy-tyrosinase is brought about by a catechol that is indirectly formed from an ortho-quinone product of tyrosinase action. The primary function of the enzyme is monooxygenation of phenols to ortho-quinones by oxy-tyrosinase. Inactivation of the enzyme results from monooxygenase processing of catechols which can lead to reductive elimination of one of the active-site copper ions and conversion of oxy-tyrosinase to the inactive deact-tyrosinase [Cu(II)Cu(0)]. This review describes the tyrosinase pathways and the role of each oxidation state in the enzyme’s oxidative transformations of phenols and catechols. © 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.;,citation_author=Christopher A.

Potential candidates include laccases which have recently received attention due to their capacity to oxidize lignin monomers and close spatial and temporal correlation with lignin deposition. We have characterized two H2O2-independent phenoloxidases with approximate molecular masses of 90 kDa and 110 kDa from cell walls of Populus euramericana xylem that are capable of oxidizing coniferyl alcohol. The 90-kDa protein was purified to apparent homogeneity and extensively characterized at the biochemical and structural levels. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a plant laccase purified to homogeneity from a lignifying tissue of an angiosperm. The cDNA clones corresponding to the 90-kDa and 110-kDa proteins, lac90 and lac110, were obtained by a PCR-based approach using specific oligonucleotides derived from peptide sequences. Sequence analysis indicated that lac90 and lac110 encoded two distinct laccases. In addition, heterologous screening using an Acer pseudoplatanus laccase cDNA enabled us to obtain three additional cDNAs (lac1, lac2, lac3) that did not correspond to lac90 and lac110. The five laccase cDNAs correspond to a highly divergent multigene family but Northern analysis with gene-specific probes indicated that all of the genes are exclusively and abundantly expressed in stems. These results highlight the polymorphism of plant laccases by an integrated biochemical and molecular approach, and provide the tools that will enable us to clearly determine the function of these enzymes in plants by molecular and genetic approaches.;,citation_author=Philippe Ranocha;,citation_author=G McDougall;,citation_author=S Hawkins;,citation_author=R Sterjiades;,citation_author=G Borderies;,citation_author=D Stewart;,citation_author=M Cabanes-Macheteau;,citation_author=a M Boudet;,citation_author=D Goffner;,citation_publication_date=1999;,citation_cover_date=1999;,citation_year=1999;,citation_doi=10.1046/j.1432-1327.1999.00061.x;,citation_isbn=0014-2956 (Print) 0014-2956 (Linking);,citation_issn=0014-2956;,citation_pmid=9914531;,citation_volume=259;,citation_journal_title=Eur.

Understanding the regulatory mechanism of secondary wall formation in grasses is necessary for exploiting these plants for agriculture and industry. Previous research has established a detailed model of the secondary wall regulatory network in the dicot model species Arabidopsis thaliana. Grasses, branching off from the dicot ancestor 140–150 million years ago, display distinct cell wall morphology and composition, suggesting potential for a different secondary wall regulation program from that established for dicots. Recently, combined application of molecular, genetic and bioinformatics approaches have revealed more transcription factors involved in secondary cell wall biosynthesis in grasses.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Acid Growth Theory of auxin-induced cell elongation is alive and well.;,citation_abstract=Plant cells elongate irreversibly only when load-bearing bonds in the walls are cleaved. Auxin causes the elongation of stem and coleoptile cells by promoting wall loosening via cleavage of these bonds. This process may be coupled with the intercalation of new cell wall polymers. Because the primary site of auxin action appears to be the plasma membrane or some intracellular site, and wall loosening is extracellular, there must be communication between the protoplast and the wall. Some &amp;amp;amp;quot;wall-loosening factor&amp;quot; must be exported from auxin-impacted cells, which sets into motion the wall loosening events. About 20 years ago, it was suggested that the wall-loosening factor is hydrogen ions. This idea and subsequent supporting data gave rise to the Acid Growth Theory, which states that when exposed to auxin, susceptible cells excrete protons into the wall (apoplast) at an enhanced rate, resulting in a decrease in apoplastic pH. The lowered wall pH then activates wall-loosening processes, the precise nature of which is unknown. Because exogenous acid causes a transient (1-4 h) increase in growth rate, auxin must also mediate events in addition to wall acidification for growth to continue for an extended period of time. These events may include osmoregulation, cell wall synthesis, and maintenance of the capacity of walls to undergo acid-induced wall loosening.

Its primary focus is integrating experimental gene function information from the peer-reviewed literature and codifying it as controlled vocabulary annotations. Our goal is to produce a “gold standard” functional annotation set that reflects the current state of knowledge about the Arabidopsis genome. At the same time, the resource serves as a nexus for community-based collaborations aimed at improving data quality, access, and reuse. For the past decade, our work has been made possible by subscriptions from our global user base. This update covers our ongoing biocuration work, some of our modernization efforts that contribute to the first major infrastructure overhaul since 2011, the introduction of JBrowse2, and the resource’s role in community activities such as organizing the structural reannotation of the genome. For gene function assessment, we used gene ontology annotations as a metric to evaluate: (1) what is currently known about Arabidopsis gene function and (2) the set of “unknown” genes. Currently, 74% of the proteome has been annotated to at least one gene ontology term. Of those loci, half have experimental support for at least one of the following aspects: molecular function, biological process, or cellular component. Our work sheds light on the genes for which we have not yet identified any published experimental data and have no functional annotation.

Owing to their broad substrate range, copper-containing laccases are versatile biocatalysts, capable of oxidizing numerous natural and non-natural industry-relevant compounds, with water as the sole by-product. In the present study, 10 of the 11 multi-copper oxidases, hitherto considered to be laccases, from fungi, plant and bacterial origin were compared. A substrate screen of 91 natural and non-natural compounds was recorded and revealed a fairly broad but distinctive substrate spectrum amongst the enzymes. Even though the enzymes share conserved active site residues we found that the substrate ranges of the individual enzymes varied considerably. The EC classification is based on the type of chemical reaction performed and the actual name of the enzyme often refers to the physiological substrate. However, for the enzymes studied in this work such classification is not feasible, even more so as their prime substrates or natural functions are mainly unknown. The classification of multi-copper oxidases assigned as laccases remains a challenge.

Several iterations of exploiting ancestral phenylpropanoid metabolism for biopolymers occurred prior to lignin that facilitated early plants’ adaptation to terrestrial environments. The first true lignin was constructed via oxidative coupling of a number of simple phenylpropanoid alcohols to form a sturdy polymer that supports long-distance water transport. This invention has directly contributed to the dominance of vascular plants in the Earth’s flora, and has had a profound impact on the establishment of the rich terrestrial ecosystems as we know them today.

In this study, we found that the hydroxystilbene glucosides isorhapontin (isorhapontigenin-O-glucoside) and, at lower levels, astringin (piceatannol-O-glucoside) and piceid (resveratrol-O-glucoside) are incorporated into the lignin polymer in Norway spruce (Picea abies) bark. The corresponding aglycones isorhapontigenin, piceatannol, and resveratrol, along with glucose, were released by derivatization followed by reductive cleavage, a chemical degradative method that cleaves \beta-ether bonds in lignin, indicating that the hydroxystilbene glucosides are (partially) incorporated into the lignin structure through \beta-ether bonds. Two-dimensional NMR analysis confirmed the occurrence of hydroxystilbene glucosides in this lignin, and provided additional information regarding their modes of incorporation into the polymer.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Flavonoids naringenin chalcone, naringenin, dihydrotricin, and tricin are lignin monomers in papyrus;,citation_abstract=Recent studies demonstrate that several polyphenolic compounds produced from beyond the canonical monolignol biosynthetic pathways can behave as lignin monomers, participating in radical coupling reactions and being incorporated into lignin polymers. Here, we show various classes of flavonoids, the chalconoid naringenin chalcone, the flavanones naringenin and dihydrotricin, and the flavone tricin, incorporated into the lignin polymer of papyrus (Cyperus papyrus L.) rind. These flavonoids were released from the rind lignin by Derivatization Followed by Reductive Cleavage (DFRC), a chemical degradative method that cleaves the \beta-ether linkages, indicating that at least a fraction of each was integrated into the lignin as \beta-ether-linked structures. Due to the particular structure of tricin and dihydrotricin, whose C-3’ and C-5’ positions at their B-rings are occupied by methoxy groups, these compounds can only be incorporated into the lignin through 4’–O–\beta bonds. However, naringenin chalcone and naringenin have no substituents at these positions and can therefore form additional carbon–carbon linkages, including 3’– or 5’–\beta linkages that form phenylcoumaran structures not susceptible to cleavage by DFRC. Furthermore, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance analysis indicated that naringenin chalcone can also form additional linkages through its conjugated double bond. The discovery expands the range of flavonoids incorporated into natural lignins, further broadens the traditional definition of lignin, and enhances the premise that any phenolic compound present at the cell wall during lignification could be oxidized and potentially integrated into the lignin structure, depending only on its chemical compatibility. This study indicates that papyrus lignin has a unique structure, as it is the only lignin known to date that integrates such a diversity of phenolic compounds from different classes of flavonoids.

Suppression of CIN activity by 38–55% led to a 9–13% reduction in crystalline cellulose. The changes in cellulose were reflected in reduced diameter of acid-insoluble cellulose microfibrils and increased glucose release from wood upon enzymatic digestion of cellulose. Reduced CIN activity decreased the amount of the cellulose biosynthesis precursor UDP-glucose in developing wood, pointing to the likely cause of the cellulose phenotype. The findings suggest that CIN activity has an important role in the cellulose biosynthesis of trees, and indicate that cellulose biosynthesis in wood relies on a quantifiable UDP-glucose pool.

In roots, a fine band of lignin, the Casparian strip encircles endodermal cells. This forms an extracellular barrier to solutes and water and plays a critical role in maintaining nutrient homeostasis. A signalling pathway senses the integrity of this diffusion barrier and can induce over-lignification to compensate for barrier defects. Here, we report that activation of this endodermal sensing mechanism triggers a transcriptional reprogramming strongly inducing the phenylpropanoid pathway and immune signaling. This leads to deposition of compensatory lignin that is chemically distinct from Casparian strip lignin.

Although the basic reactions of the phenolics biosynthetic pathways in plants have been intensively analyzed, the regulation of their accumulation and flux through the pathway is not that well established. The aim of this study was to use a strawberry (Fragaria  ananassa) microarray to investigate gene expression patterns associated with the accumulation of phenylpropanoids, flavonoids, and anthocyanins in strawberry fruit. An examination of the transcriptome, coupled with metabolite profiling data from different commercial varieties, was undertaken to identify genes whose expression correlated with altered phenolics composition. Seventeen comparative microarray analyses revealed 15 genes that were differentially (more than 200-fold) expressed in phenolics-rich versus phenolics-poor varieties. The results were validated by heterologous expression of the peroxidase FaPRX27 gene, which showed the highest altered expression level (more than 900-fold). The encoded protein was functionally characterized and is assumed to be involved in lignin formation during strawberry fruit ripening. Quantitative trait locus analysis indicated that the genomic region of FaPRX27 is associated with the fruit color trait. Down-regulation of the CHALCONE SYNTHASE gene and concomitant induction of FaPRX27 expression diverted the flux from anthocyanins to lignin. The results highlight the competition of the different phenolics pathways for their common precursors.

The extracellular domain of KOR1 contains eight N-glycosylation sites, N1 to N8, of which only N3 to N7 are highly conserved. Genetic evidence indicated that cellular defects in attachment and maturation of these N-glycans affect KOR1 function in vivo, whereas the manner by which N-glycans modulate KOR1 function remained obscure. Site-directed mutagenesis analysis of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-KOR1 expressed from its native regulatory sequences established that all eight N-glycosylation sites (N1 to N8) are used in the wild type, whereas stt3a-2 cells could only inefficiently add N-glycans to less conserved sites. GFP-KOR1 variants with a single N-glycan at nonconserved sites were less effective than those with one at a highly conserved site in rescuing the root growth phenotype of rsw2-1 (kor1 allele). When functionally compromised, GFP-KOR1 tended to accumulate at the tonoplast. GFP-KOR1\Deltaall (without any N-glycan) exhibited partial complementation of rsw2-1; however, root growth of this line was still negatively affected by the absence of complex-type N-glycan modifications in the host plants.

Using immunofluorescence and a green fluorescent protein (GFP)–KOR1 fusion that complemented the phenotype conferred by the kor1-1 mutant, we investigated the distribution of KOR1 in epidermal cells in the root meristem. KOR1 was localized in intracellular compartments corresponding to a heterogeneous population of organelles, which comprised the Golgi apparatus, FM4-64–labeled compartments referred to as early endosomes, and, in the case of GFP-KOR1, the tonoplast. Inhibition of cellulose synthesis by isoxaben promoted a net redistribution of GFP-KOR1 toward a homogeneous population of compartments, distinct from early endosomes, which were concentrated close to the plasma membrane facing the root surface.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Broad Bean Leaf Polyphenol Oxidase Is a 60-Kilodalton Protein Susceptible to Proteolytic Cleavage;,citation_abstract=Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) in leaves is generally considered to be a 45-kilodalton protein. PPO purified to homogeneity from broad bean (Vicia faba L.) leaves in the presence of protease inhibitors had an apparent molecular mass of 60 kD determined by denaturing sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Under partially denaturing conditions, the protein had an apparent molecular mass of 43 kilodaltons, but this was shifted to 60 kilodaltons in the presence of sulfhydryl reductants, suggesting the presence of disulfide bonding. The purified protein was totally latent; i.e. PPO activity was only detected when assayed with sodium dodecyl sulfate. Treatment with proteases in the presence of 0.1% SDS inhibited enzyme activity, but in the absence of SDS the 60-kilodalton PPO was proteolytically cleaved with no loss of PPO activity. This yielded a 42-kilodalton peptide that had PPO activity and inactive peptides of 12 to 18 kilodaltons. Amino acid sequencing established that the 42-kilodalton protein was derived from the N-terminal end of the 60-kilodalton form of PPO. By comparison with the sequence of a cDNA clone for broad bean leaf PPO, the 18-kilodalton peptide was located at the C-terminal end of the 60-kilodalton protein. Northern analysis of mRNA from broad bean leaves probed with a cDNA clone of PPO identified a transcript of 2.2 kilobase pairs, which is more than sufficient to encode the 60-kilodalton protein. It is concluded that PPO is a 60-kilodalton protein in broad bean leaves but that it is susceptible to proteolysis during extraction, removing a peptide of 15 to 18 kilodaltons from the C-terminal end without decreasing enzyme activity.;,citation_author=Simon P.

There are escalating needs for analyses to be robust, reproducible, accurate, and efficient. We have recently modified an established protocol for discrimination of lignin monomers, thioacidolysis, with the goal of increasing sample throughput while maintaining accuracy and reducing equipment load and consumption of reagents. Numerous methodological changes related to volume scaling, selection of the processing vessel, and sample handling were addressed. The revised protocol permitted rapid processing of some 50 or more samples per person per day. A direct comparison between methods using hybrid poplar (Populus alba  tremula) wood samples, resulted in quantities of p-hydroxyphenyl (H), guaiacyl (G), and syringyl (S) lignin monomers that were equivalent to those derived from the original protocol. The revised methodology was then applied to quickly generate phenotypic trait data from 267 hybrid poplar trees (including wild type and eight C4H::F5H transgenic lines), for the development of a near-infrared-based model for predicting the proportion of lignin monomers across a broad phenotypic range of S:G. The resulting partial least squares regression model performed well under full cross-validation, giving strong, linear relationships between actual and predicted monomer proportions, and very high predictive accuracy for the predominant G and S monomers. This research brings considerable refinement to the thioacidolysis procedure, and establishes a method for rapidly and accurately quantifying cell-wall lignin composition that could effectively be employed in routine phenotypic screening platforms.;,citation_author=Andrew R.

In plants, endogenous and pathogenic proteins gained the ability to target plasmodesmata, membrane-lined cytoplasmic connections, through evolution to regulate or exploit cellular signaling across cell wall boundaries. For example, the receptor-like membrane protein PLASMODESMATA-LOCATED PROTEIN 5 (PDLP5), a potent regulator of plasmodesmal permeability, generates feed-forward or feed-back signals important for plant immunity and root development. However, the molecular features that determine the plasmodesmal association of PDLP5 or other proteins remain largely unknown, and no protein motifs have been identified as plasmodesmal targeting signals. Here, we developed an approach combining custom-built machine-learning algorithms and targeted mutagenesis to examine PDLP5 in Arabidopsis thaliana and Nicotiana benthamiana. We report that PDLP5 and its closely related proteins carry unconventional targeting signals consisting of short stretches of amino acids. PDLP5 contains 2 divergent, tandemly arranged signals, either of which is sufficient for localization and biological function in regulating viral movement through plasmodesmata. Notably, plasmodesmal targeting signals exhibit little sequence conservation but are located similarly proximal to the membrane.

RAPID ALKALINIZATION FACTOR (RALF) are extracellular peptide hormones that play pivotal roles in various physiological processes. Here, we unveil a crucial connection between the demethylation machinery of the cell wall component pectin and RALF1 activity. Pectin is a polysaccharide homogalacturonan, contributing to the structural integrity of the cell wall. Our data illustrate that the pharmacological and genetic interference with PECTIN METHYL ESTERASEs (PMEs) abolishes RALF1 perception. Similarly, the application of free demethylated oligogalacturonides in the medium also reduces RALF1 activity. Accordingly, we conclude that RALF1 requires demethylated pectin to signal at the cell surface. We propose that demethylated and hence negatively charged pectin acts as a signalling scaffold for the positively charged RALF peptides, defining its output signalling. This mode of RALF peptide hormone signalling could shed light on a broader plant developmental context, linking extracellular matrix dynamics to hormone-mediated responses.;,citation_author=Ann-Kathrin Roessling;,citation_author=Kai Dunser;,citation_author=Lothar Kalmbach;,citation_author=Elke Barbez;,citation_author=Jurgen Kleine-Vehn;,citation_publication_date=2023-08;,citation_cover_date=2023-08;,citation_year=2023;,citation_doi=10.1101/2023.08.18.553913;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_publisher=bioRxiv;">

Whereas PAL function is well established in various plants, an insight into the functional significance of individual gene family members is lacking. We show that in the absence of clear phenotypic alterations in the Arabidopsis pal1 and pal2 single mutants and with limited phenotypic alterations in the pal1 pal2 double mutant, significant modifications occur in the transcriptome and metabolome of the pal mutants. The disruption of PAL led to transcriptomic adaptation of components of the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, and amino acid metabolism, revealing complex interactions at the level of gene expression between these pathways. Corresponding biochemical changes included a decrease in the three major flavonol glycosides, glycosylated vanillic acid, scopolin, and two novel feruloyl malates coupled to coniferyl alcohol. Moreover, Phe overaccumulated in the double mutant, and the levels of many other amino acids were significantly imbalanced. The lignin content was significantly reduced, and the syringyl/guaiacyl ratio of lignin monomers had increased. Together, from the molecular phenotype, common and specific functions of PAL1 and PAL2 are delineated, and PAL1 is qualified as being more important for the generation of phenylpropanoids.;,citation_author=Antje Rohde;,citation_author=Kris Morreel;,citation_author=John Ralph;,citation_author=Geert Goeminne;,citation_author=Vanessa Hostyn;,citation_author=Riet De Rycke;,citation_author=Sergej Kushnir;,citation_author=Jan Van Doorsselaere;,citation_author=Jean-Paul Joseleau;,citation_author=Marnik Vuylsteke;,citation_author=Gonzalez Van Driessche;,citation_author=Jozef Van Beeumen;,citation_author=Eric Messens;,citation_author=Wout Boerjan;,citation_publication_date=2004-10;,citation_cover_date=2004-10;,citation_year=2004;,citation_issue=10;,citation_doi=10.1105/tpc.104.023705;,citation_issn=1040-4651;,citation_volume=16;,citation_journal_title=Plant Cell;">

However, it is unclear on which timescale these changes in cell wall composition occurred. Here, we subjected H. annuus to control (i.e. water availability), different levels of short-term water deficit stress (ST), long-term water deficit stress (LT), and long-term water deficit stress followed by gradual recoveries addressed at different timescales (LT-Rec) to evaluate the dynamics of modifications in the main composition of cell wall (cellulose, hemicelluloses, pectins and lignins) affecting photosynthesis. During gradual ST treatments, pectins enhancement was associated with gm decline. However, during LT-Rec, pectins content decreased significantly after only 5 h, while hemicelluloses and lignins amounts changed after 24 h, all being uncoupled from gm. Surprisingly, lignins increased by around 200% compared with control and were related to stomatal conductance to gas diffusion (gs) during LT-Rec.

In the context of genome integrity, signaling cascades driven by phosphorylation are crucial for the coordination and regulation of DNA repair. The two serine/threonine protein kinases ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) and Ataxia telangiectasia-mutated and Rad3-related (ATR) are key factors in this process, each specific for different kinds of DNA lesions.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=High-order mutants reveal an essential requirement for peroxidases but not laccases in Casparian strip lignification;,citation_abstract=Lignin has enabled plants to colonize land, grow tall, transport water within their bodies, and protect themselves against various stresses. Consequently, this polyphenolic polymer, impregnating cellulosic plant cell walls, is the second most abundant polymer on Earth. Yet, despite its great physiological, ecological, and economical importance, our knowledge of lignin biosynthesis in vivo, especially the polymerization steps within the cell wall, remains vague—specifically, the respective roles of the two polymerizing enzymes classes, laccases and peroxidases. One reason for this lies in the very high numbers of laccases and peroxidases encoded by 17 and 73 homologous genes, respectively, in Arabidopsis. Here, we have focused on a specific lignin structure, the ring-like Casparian strips (CSs) within the root endodermis. By reducing candidate numbers using cellular resolution expression and localization data and by boosting stacking of mutants using CRISPR-Cas9, we mutated the majority of laccases in Arabidopsis in a nonuple mutant—essentially abolishing laccases with detectable endodermal expression. Yet, we were unable to detect even slight defects in CS formation. By contrast, we were able to induce a complete absence of CS formation in a quintuple peroxidase mutant. Our findings are in stark contrast to the strong requirement of xylem vessels for laccase action and indicate that lignin in different cell types can be polymerized in very distinct ways.

With this note, we announce the release of version 3.2, a major upgrade to the latest official release presented in 2003. The new version provides convergence diagnostics and allows multiple analyses to be run in parallel with convergence progress monitored on the fly. The introduction of new proposals and automatic optimization of tuning parameters has improved convergence for many problems. The new version also sports significantly faster likelihood calculations through streaming single-instruction-multiple-data extensions (SSE) and support of the BEAGLE library, allowing likelihood calculations to be delegated to graphics processing units (GPUs) on compatible hardware. Speedup factors range from around 2 with SSE code to more than 50 with BEAGLE for codon problems. Checkpointing across all models allows long runs to be completed even when an analysis is prematurely terminated. New models include relaxed clocks, dating, model averaging across time-reversible substitution models, and support for hard, negative, and partial (backbone) tree constraints. Inference of species trees from gene trees is supported by full incorporation of the Bayesian estimation of species trees (BEST) algorithms. Marginal model likelihoods for Bayes factor tests can be estimated accurately across the entire model space using the stepping stone method. The new version provides more output options than previously, including samples of ancestral states, site rates, site dN/dS rations, branch rates, and node dates.

However, the mechanistic basis of this life history trade-off is not well understood. In addition to resource allocation conflicts among multiple traits, functional conflicts arising from individual morphological traits may also contribute to life history trade-offs. We hypothesized that conflicting functional effects of xylem structural traits contribute to the growth-longevity trade-off in trees. We tested this hypothesis by examining the extent to which xylem morphological traits (i.e., wood density, tracheid diameters, and pit structure) relate to growth rates and longevity in two natural populations of the conifer species Pinus ponderosa . Hydraulic constraints arise as trees grow larger and xylem anatomical traits adjust to compensate. We disentangled the effects of size through ontogeny in individual trees and growth rates among trees on xylem traits by sampling each tree at multiple trunk diameters. We found that the oldest trees had slower lifetime growth rates compared with younger trees in the studied populations, indicating a growth-longevity trade-off. We further provide evidence that a single xylem trait, pit structure, with conflicting effects on xylem function (hydraulic safety and efficiency) relates to the growth-longevity trade-off in a conifer species. This study highlights that, in addition to trade-offs among multiple traits, functional constraints based on individual morphological traits like that of pit structure provide mechanistic insight into how and when life history trade-offs arise.;,citation_author=Beth Roskilly;,citation_author=Eric Keeling;,citation_author=Sharon Hood;,citation_author=Arnaud Giuggiola;,citation_author=Anna Sala;,citation_publication_date=2019-07;,citation_cover_date=2019-07;,citation_year=2019;,citation_issue=30;,citation_doi=10.1073/pnas.1900734116;,citation_issn=0027-8424, 1091-6490;,citation_volume=116;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Proc.

Lateral roots (LRs) seemingly suppress positive gravitropic growth and show a defined gravitropic set-point angle (GSA) that allows radial expansion of the root system (plagiotropism) [3, 4]. Despite its eminent importance for root architecture, it so far remains completely unknown how lateral organs partially suppress positive orthogravitropism. Here we show that the phytohormone auxin steers GSA formation and limits positive orthogravitropism in LR. Low and high auxin levels/signaling lead to radial or axial root systems, respectively. At a cellular level, it is the auxin transport-dependent regulation of asymmetric growth in the elongation zone that determines GSA. Our data suggest that strong repression of PIN4/PIN7 and transient PIN3 expression limit auxin redistribution in young LR columella cells. We conclude that PIN activity, by temporally limiting the asymmetric auxin fluxes in the tip of LRs, induces transient, differential growth responses in the elongation zone and, consequently, controls root architecture.;,citation_author=Michel Ruiz Rosquete;,citation_author=Daniel Wangenheim;,citation_author=Peter Marhavý;,citation_author=Elke Barbez;,citation_author=Ernst H.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=AtTRAPPC11/ROG2: A Role for TRAPPs in Maintenance of the Plant Trans-Golgi Network/Early Endosome Organization and Function;,citation_abstract=The dynamic trans-Golgi network/early endosome (TGN/EE) facilitates cargo sorting and trafficking and plays a vital role in plant development and environmental response. Transport protein particles (TRAPPs) are multi-protein complexes acting as guanine nucleotide exchange factors and possibly as tethers, regulating intracellular trafficking. TRAPPs are essential in all eukaryotic cells and are implicated in a number of human diseases. It has been proposed that they also play crucial roles in plants; however, our current knowledge about the structure and function of plant TRAPPs is very limited. Here, we identified and characterized AtTRAPPC11/RESPONSE TO OLIGOGALACTURONIDE2 (AtTRAPPC11/ROG2), a TGN/EE-associated, evolutionarily conserved TRAPP protein in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). AtTRAPPC11/ROG2 regulates TGN integrity, as evidenced by altered TGN/EE association of several residents, including SYNTAXIN OF PLANTS61, and altered vesicle morphology in attrappc11/rog2 mutants. Furthermore, endocytic traffic and brefeldin A body formation are perturbed in attrappc11/rog2, suggesting a role for AtTRAPPC11/ROG2 in regulation of endosomal function. Proteomic analysis showed that AtTRAPPC11/ROG2 defines a hitherto uncharacterized TRAPPIII complex in plants. In addition, attrappc11/rog2 mutants are hypersensitive to salinity, indicating an undescribed role of TRAPPs in stress responses. Overall, our study illustrates the plasticity of the endomembrane system through TRAPP protein functions and opens new avenues to explore this dynamic network.;,citation_author=Michel Ruiz Rosquete;,citation_author=Natasha Worden;,citation_author=Guangxi Ren;,citation_author=Rosalie M.

Three enzymes, MAP1A, MAP2A, and MAP2B, have been identified in the cytoplasm of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). MAP transcript quantification revealed a predominance of MAP2B and developmental and organ-specific regulation of both MAP1A and MAP2s. By combining reverse genetics and reverse chemogenomics in transgenic plant lines, we have devised specific and reversible switches for the investigation of the role of cytoplasmic NME in Arabidopsis and of the respective contributions of the two types of cytoplasmic MAPs throughout development. dsRNA interference and knockout (KO) plant lines targeting either MAP1A alone or both MAP2s simultaneously were constructed and shown to display wild-type phenotypes. In the MAP1A KO context, modulating MAP2 activity by treatment with various concentrations of the specific drug fumagillin impaired plant development, with particularly strong effects on the root system. Reciprocally, complete MAP2 inhibition in various MAP1A knocked-down genetic backgrounds also generated a gradient of developmentally abnormal plants, but the effects on the root system were milder than in the KO context. In the absence of MAP2 activity, the severity of the phenotype in the MAP1A knocked-down lines was correlated to the extent of MAP1A mRNA accumulation. Complete cytoplasmic NME inactivation blocked development after plant germination. Thus, in plants, (1) cytoplasmic NME is essential; (2) MAP1A and MAP2s are functionally interchangeable, which is not the case in fungi and animals, as a complete block of either MAP-type activity does not cause any visible molecular or phenotypic effect; and (3) a minimal level of cytoplasmic MAP is required for normal development.;,citation_author=Simon Ross;,citation_author=Carmela Giglione;,citation_author=Michèle Pierre;,citation_author=Christelle Espagne;,citation_author=Thierry Meinnel;,citation_publication_date=2005;,citation_cover_date=2005;,citation_year=2005;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1104/pp.104.056861;,citation_isbn=0032-0889 (Print){\textbackslash}r0032-0889 (Linking);,citation_issn=0032-0889;,citation_pmid=15681659;,citation_volume=137;,citation_journal_title=Plant Physiol.;">

Cellulose microfibrils are the primary anisotropic material in the cell wall and thus are likely to be the main determinant of the orientation of cell expansion. COBRA (COB) has been identified previously as a potential regulator of cellulose biogenesis. In this study, characterization of a null allele, cob-4, establishes the key role of COB in controlling anisotropic expansion in most developing organs. Quantitative polarized-light and field-emission scanning electron microscopy reveal that loss of anisotropic expansion in cob mutants is accompanied by disorganization of the orientation of cellulose microfibrils and subsequent reduction of crystalline cellulose. Analyses of the conditional cob-1 allele suggested that COB is primarily implicated in microfibril deposition during rapid elongation. Immunodetection analysis in elongating root cells revealed that, in agreement with its substitution by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor, COB was polarly targeted to both the plasma membrane and the longitudinal cell walls and was distributed in a banding pattern perpendicular to the longitudinal axis via a microtubule-dependent mechanism. Our observations suggest that COB, through its involvement in cellulose microfibril orientation, is an essential factor in highly anisotropic expansion during plant morphogenesis.;,citation_author=François Roudier;,citation_author=Anita G.

The algorithm was tested using different combinations of diaminobenzidine, hematoxylin and eosin at different staining levels. RESULTS: Quantification of the different stains was not significantly influenced by the combination of multiple stains in a single sample. The color deconvolution algorithm resulted in comparable quantification independent of the stain combinations as long as the histochemical procedures did not influence the amount of stain in the sample due to bleaching because of stain solubility and saturation of staining was prevented.

Versatile peroxidase (VP) differs not only in its oxidation of Mn2+ at a second catalytic site but also in its ability to directly oxidize different aromatic compounds. The catalytic tryptophan environment was compared in LiP and VP crystal structures, and six residues near VP Trp164 were modified by site-directed mutagenesis. Oxidation of Mn2+ was practically unaffected. However, several mutations modified the oxidation kinetics of the high-redox-potential substrates VA and Reactive Black 5 (RB5), demonstrating that other residues contribute to substrate oxidation by the Trp164 radical. Introducing acidic residues at the tryptophan environment did not increase the efficiency of VP oxidizing VA. On the contrary, all variants harboring the R257D mutation lost their activity on RB5. Interestingly, this activity was restored when VA was added as a mediator, revealing the LiP-type behavior of this variant. Moreover, combination of the A260F and R257A mutations strongly increased (20-50-fold) the apparent second-order rate constants for reduction of VP compounds I and II by VA to values similar to those found in LiP. Dissociation of the enzyme-product complex seemed to be the limiting step in the turnover of this improved variant. Nonexposed residues in the vicinity of Trp164 can also affect VP activity, as found with the M247F mutation. This was a direct effect since no modification of the surrounding residues was found in the crystal structure of this variant.;,citation_author=Francisco J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Substrate oxidation sites in versatile peroxidase and other basidiomycete peroxidases;,citation_abstract=Versatile peroxidase (VP) is defined by its capabilities to oxidize the typical substrates of other basidiomycete peroxidases: (i) Mn(2+), the manganese peroxidase (MnP) substrate (Mn(3+) being able to oxidize phenols and initiate lipid peroxidation reactions); (ii) veratryl alcohol (VA), the typical lignin peroxidase (LiP) substrate; and (iii) simple phenols, which are the substrates of Coprinopsis cinerea peroxidase (CIP). Crystallographic, spectroscopic, directed mutagenesis, and kinetic studies showed that these ’hybrid’ properties are due to the coexistence in a single protein of different catalytic sites reminiscent of those present in the other basidiomycete peroxidase families. Crystal structures of wild and recombinant VP, and kinetics of mutated variants, revealed certain differences in its Mn-oxidation site compared with MnP. These result in efficient Mn(2+) oxidation in the presence of only two of the three acidic residues forming its binding site. On the other hand, a solvent-exposed tryptophan is the catalytically-active residue in VA oxidation, initiating an electron transfer pathway to haem (two other putative pathways were discarded by mutagenesis). Formation of a tryptophanyl radical after VP activation by peroxide was detected using electron paramagnetic resonance. This was the first time that a protein radical was directly demonstrated in a ligninolytic peroxidase. In contrast with LiP, the VP catalytic tryptophan is not beta-hydroxylated under hydrogen peroxide excess. It was also shown that the tryptophan environment affected catalysis, its modification introducing some LiP properties in VP. Moreover, some phenols and dyes are oxidized by VP at the edge of the main haem access channel, as found in CIP. Finally, the biotechnological interest of VP is discussed.;,citation_author=F. J.

The extent of radical generation is similar to that of 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamyl alcohol and is increased by further aromatic methoxylation. From the distribution of the electron-spin density, it was predicted that the regiochemistry of 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamaldehyde coupling would be similar to that of the corresponding alcohol, with the possibility of a higher degree of 8-O-4 linkages occurring. These predictions were confirmed by polymerisation studies, which also showed that after radical coupling the \alpha,\beta-enone structure was regenerated. This suggests that, although the cross-linking and physical properties of cinnamaldeyde rich lignins differ from that of normal lignins, cinnamaldehydes are incorporated into the lignin polymer under the same controlling factors as the cinnamyl alcohols.;,citation_author=Wendy R Russell;,citation_author=Gordon J Provan;,citation_author=Mark J Burkitt;,citation_author=Andrew Chesson;,citation_publication_date=2000-04;,citation_cover_date=2000-04;,citation_year=2000;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1016/S0168-1656(00)00212-1;,citation_issn=0168-1656;,citation_volume=79;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=J.

We functionally analyzed Group IIId Arabidopsis AP2/EREBP genes, namely ERF34, ERF35, ERF38, and ERF39, which are homologs of a rice ERF gene previously proposed to be related to SCW biosynthesis.

Evidence exists that cellulose microfibril structure and its recalcitrance to enzymatic digestion can ameliorated via mis-sense mutation in the primary cell wall-specific gene AtCELLULOSE SYNTHASE (CESA)3. This mis-sense mutation has been identified based on conferring drug resistance to the cellulose inhibitory herbicide isoxaben. To examine whether it would be possible to introduce mutant CESA alleles via a transgenic approach, we overexpressed a modified version of CESA3, AtCESA3(ixr1-2) derived from Arabidopsis thaliana L. Heynh into a different plant family, the Solanceae dicotyledon tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L. variety Samsun NN). Specifically, a chimeric gene construct of CESA3(ixr1-2) , codon optimized for tobacco, was placed between the heterologous M24 promoter and the rbcSE9 gene terminator. The results demonstrated that the tobacco plants expressing M24-CESA3(ixr1-2) displayed isoxaben resistance, consistent with functionality of the mutated AtCESA3(ixr1-2) in tobacco. Secondly, during enzymatic saccharification, transgenic leaf- and stem-derived cellulose is 54%-66% and 40%-51% more efficient, respectively, compared to the wild type, illustrating translational potential of modified CESA loci. Moreover, the introduction of M24-AtCESA3(ixr1-2) caused aberrant spatial distribution of lignified secondary cell wall tissue and a reduction in the zone occupied by parenchyma cells.;,citation_author=Dipak K.

In this report, we used time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) to directly map guaiacyl (G) and syringyl (S) lignin units in several successive growth rings of the maple xylem. TOF-SIMS imaging and a semiquantitative approach revealed clear difference in the annual distribution of lignins between the fiber and vessel. While the vessel walls were constantly G-rich with varied S/G ratios through a growth ring, the fibers showed fairly regular annual distribution of lignins in which the earlywood was S-rich with an almost constant S/G ratio and the latewood was G-rich resulting from a decrease of the S unit. The reliability of TOF-SIMS results was demonstrated by its high correlation with the results of thioacidolysis on radial distribution of the S/G ratio in several contiguous tree rings and also in the latewood and earlywood of each ring.

Type I Cu mediates electron transfer between the substrate and the trinuclear Cu center formed by a type II Cu and a pair of type III Cu’s, where the final electron acceptor O(2) is converted to H(2)O without releasing activated oxygen species. During the process, O(2) is reduced by MCOs such as lacquer laccase and bilirubin oxidase; the reaction intermediate II with a possible doubly OH(-)-bridged structure in the trinuclear Cu center has been detected. The preceding reaction intermediate I has been detected by the reaction of the lacquer laccase in a mixed valence state, at which type I Cu was cuprous and the trinuclear Cu center was fully reduced, and by the reaction of the Cys –&amp;amp;amp;gt; Ser mutant for the type I Cu site in bilirubin oxidase and CueO. An acidic amino acid residue located adjacent to the trinuclear Cu center was proved to function as a proton donor to these reaction intermediates. The substrate specificity of MCO for organic substrates is produced by the integrated effects of the shape of the substrate-binding site and the specific interaction of the substrate with the amino acid located adjacent to the His residue coordinating to the type I Cu. In contrast, the substrate specificity of the cuprous oxidase, CueO, is produced by the segment covering the Cu(I)-binding site so as to obstruct the access of organic substrates. Truncating the segment spanning helix 5 to helix 7 greatly reduced the specificity of CueO for Cu(I) and prominently enhanced the low oxidizing activity for the organic substrates, indicating the success of protein engineering to modify the substrate specificity of MCO.;,citation_author=Takeshi Sakurai;,citation_author=Kunishige Kataoka;,citation_publication_date=2007;,citation_cover_date=2007;,citation_year=2007;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1002/tcr.20125;,citation_isbn=1527-8999 (Print);,citation_issn=15278999;,citation_pmid=17663447;,citation_volume=7;,citation_journal_title=Chem.

However, the general function of this enzyme was recently questioned by the apparent lack of CSE activity in lignifying tissues of different plant species. Here, we show that down-regulation of CSE in hybrid poplar (Populus tremula  Populus alba) resulted in up to 25% reduced lignin deposition, increased levels of p-hydroxyphenyl units in the lignin polymer, and a relatively higher cellulose content. The transgenic trees were morphologically indistinguishable from the wild type. Ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based phenolic profiling revealed a reduced abundance of several oligolignols containing guaiacyl and syringyl units and their corresponding hydroxycinnamaldehyde units, in agreement with the reduced flux toward coniferyl and sinapyl alcohol. These trees accumulated the CSE substrate caffeoyl shikimate along with other compounds belonging to the metabolic classes of benzenoids and hydroxycinnamates. Furthermore, the reduced lignin amount combined with the relative increase in cellulose content in the CSE down-regulated lines resulted in up to 62% more glucose released per plant upon limited saccharification when no pretreatment was applied and by up to 86% and 91% when acid and alkaline pretreatments were used.

In organisms with cell walls, the wall acts as a primary constraint of shape, and generation of specific cell shape depends on cytoskeletal organization for wall deposition and/or cell expansion. In higher plants, cortical microtubules help to organize cell wall construction by positioning the delivery of cellulose synthase (CesA) complexes and guiding their trajectories to orient newly synthesized cellulose microfibrils. The actin cytoskeleton is required for normal distribution of CesAs to the plasma membrane, but more specific roles for actin in cell wall assembly and organization remain largely elusive. We show that the actin cytoskeleton functions to regulate the CesA delivery rate to, and lifetime of CesAs at, the plasma membrane, which affects cellulose production. Furthermore, quantitative image analyses revealed that actin organization affects CesA tracking behavior at the plasma membrane and that small CesA compartments were associated with the actin cytoskeleton. By contrast, localized insertion of CesAs adjacent to cortical microtubules was not affected by the actin organization.

Associations with hemicelluloses are important for microfibril spacing and for maintaining cell wall tensile strength. Several components associated with cellulose synthesis have been identified; however, the biological functions for many of them remain elusive. We show that the chitinase-like (CTL) proteins, CTL1/POM1 and CTL2, are functionally equivalent, affect cellulose biosynthesis, and are likely to play a key role in establishing interactions between cellulose microfibrils and hemicelluloses. CTL1/POM1 coincided with CESAs in the endomembrane system and was secreted to the apoplast. The movement of CESAs was compromised in ctl1/pom1 mutant seedlings, and the cellulose content and xyloglucan structures were altered. X-ray analysis revealed reduced crystalline cellulose content in ctl1 ctl2 double mutants, suggesting that the CTLs cooperatively affect assembly of the glucan chains, which may affect interactions between hemicelluloses and cellulose. Consistent with this hypothesis, both CTLs bound glucan-based polymers in vitro.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Cellulose Synthases Are Cargo of the TPLATE Adaptor Complex;,citation_abstract=Cellulose is a critical component of plant cell walls. Cellulose is made at the plasma membrane by cellulose synthase (CESA) enzymes organized into large, multi-subunit cellulose synthase complexes (CSCs). Although CESAs are only active at the plasma membrane, fluorescently-tagged CESAs also substantially label the Golgi apparatus and other intracellular compartments, even when cellulose synthesis rates are high. These data imply that CESA activity is regulated by trafficking to the plasma membrane (exocytosis) and removal from the plasma membrane (endocytosis), as well as recycling of endocytosed CESAs back to the plasma membrane. Key molecular components and events of CESA exocytosis and endocytosis have recently been defined, primarily using mutant analysis and live-cell imaging in Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, we integrate these data into a working model of CESA regulation by exocytosis and endocytosis and highlight key outstanding questions. We present the hypothesis that cycling of CESAs between the plasma membrane and the endomembrane system is important for regulating cellulose synthesis and for maintaining a robust population of active CSCs in the plasma membrane. Cotton is one of the most important economic crops in the world, with over 90 % cellulose in the mature fiber. However, the cellulose synthesis mechanism in cotton fibers is poorly understood. Here, we identified four DUF288 domain containing proteins, which we designated GhSTL1-4. These four GhSTL genes are highly expressed in 6 days post anthesis (dpa) and 20 dpa cotton fibers. They are localized to the Golgi apparatus, and can rescue the growth defects in primary cell wall (PCW) and secondary cell wall (SCW) of cellulose synthesis of the Arabidopsis stl1stl2 double mutant at varying degrees. Silencing of GhSTLs resulted in reduced cellulose content and shorter fibers. In addition, split-ubiquitin membrane yeast two-hybrid analysis showed that GhSTL1 and GhSTL4 can interact with PCW-related GhCesA6-1/6-3 and SCW-associated GhCesA7-1/7-2. GhSTL3 can interact with SCW-related GhCesA4-3. These interactions are further confirmed by firefly luciferase complementation imaging assay. Together, we demonstrate that GhSTLs can selectively interact with both the PCW and SCW-associated GhCesAs and impact on cellulose synthesis and fiber development. Our findings provide insights into the mechanism underlying cellulose biosynthesis in cotton fibers, and offer potential candidate genes to coordinate PCW and SCW cellulose synthesis of cotton fibers for developing elite cotton varieties with enhanced fiber quality. Cellulose is produced at the plasma membrane of plant cells by cellulose synthase (CESA) complexes (CSCs). CSCs are assembled in the endomembrane system and then trafficked to the plasma membrane. Because CESAs are only active in the plasma membrane, control of CSC secretion regulates cellulose synthesis. We identified members of a family of seven transmembrane domain-containing proteins (7TMs) that are important for cellulose production during cell wall integrity stress. 7TMs are often associated with guanine nucleotide-binding (G) protein signaling and we found that mutants affecting the G\beta\gamma dimer phenocopied the 7tm mutants. Unexpectedly, the 7TMs localized to the Golgi/trans-Golgi network where they interacted with G protein components. Here, the 7TMs and G\beta\gamma regulated CESA trafficking but did not affect general protein secretion. Our results outline how a G protein-coupled module regulates CESA trafficking and reveal that defects in this process lead to exacerbated responses to cell wall integrity stress. Organelles of the plant cell cooperate to synthesize and secrete a strong yet flexible polysaccharide-based extracellular matrix: the cell wall. Cell wall composition varies among plant species, across cell types within a plant, within different regions of a single cell wall, and in response to intrinsic or extrinsic signals. This diversity in cell wall makeup is underpinned by common cellular mechanisms for cell wall production. Cellulose synthase complexes function at the plasma membrane and deposit their product into the cell wall. Matrix polysaccharides are synthesized by a multitude of glycosyltransferases in hundreds of mobile Golgi stacks, and an extensive set of vesicle trafficking proteins govern secretion to the cell wall. In this review, we discuss the different subcellular locations at which cell wall synthesis occurs, review the molecular mechanisms that control cell wall biosynthesis, and examine how these are regulated in response to different perturbations to maintain cell wall homeostasis. Cellulose is a \beta-1,4 linked glucose polymer that is synthesized by higher plants, algae and even by some bacteria and animals, making it the most abundant polymer on earth. As the major load bearing structure of the plant cell wall, it is hugely important in terms of plant growth and development, and in recent years it has gained interest for its biotechnological applications. Naturally, there has been a large concerted research effort to uncover the regulatory mechanisms underpinning cellulose synthesis. During the last century, several major breakthroughs in our understanding of cellulose synthesis in algae, bacteria, and plants have been pivotal in advancing the field of cellulose research, improving the likelihood that cellulose synthesis could be feasibly adapted for sustainable purposes. In this review, we will summarize the major hypotheses and advancements made during the last century on the regulation of cellulose biosynthesis, focussing on Arabidopsis thaliana. Cellulose is an essential morphogenic polysaccharide that is central to the stability of plant cell walls and provides an important raw material for a range of plant-based fiber and fuel industries. The past decade has seen a substantial rise in the identification of cellulose synthesis-related components and in our understanding of how these components function. Much of this research has been conducted in Arabidopsis thaliana (arabidopsis); however, it has become increasingly evident that many of the components and their functions are conserved. We provide here an overview of cellulose synthesis “core” components.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=An UMAMIT-GTR transporter cascade controls glucosinolate seed loading in arabidopsis;,citation_abstract=Many plant species translocate maternally synthesized specialized metabolites to the seed to protect the developing embryo and later the germinating seedling before it initiates its own de novo synthesis. While the transport route into the seed is well established for primary metabolites, no model exists for any class of specialized metabolites that move from maternal source tissue(s) to embryo. Glucosinolate seed loading in Arabidopsis depends on plasma membrane localized exporters (USUALLY MULTIPLE AMINO ACIDS MOVE IN AND OUT TRANSPORTERs, UMAMITs) and importers (GLUCOSINOLATE TRANSPORTERs, GTRs), but the critical barriers in the seed loading process remain unknown. Here we dissect the transport route of glucosinolates from their source in the reproductive organ to the embryo by re-introducing the transporters at specific apoplastic barriers in their respective mutant backgrounds. We find that UMAMIT exporters and GTR importers form a transporter cascade that is both essential and sufficient for moving glucosinolates across at least four plasma membrane barriers along the route. We propose a model in which UMAMITs export glucosinolates out of the biosynthetic cells to the apoplast, from where GTRs import them into the phloem stream, which moves them to the unloading zone in the chalazal seed coat. From here, the UMAMITs export them out of maternal tissue and ultimately, the GTRs import them into the embryo symplasm, where the seed-specific glucosinolate profile is established by enzymatic modifications. Moreover, we propose that methylsulfinylalkyl glucosinolates are the predominant mobile form in seed loading. Elucidation of the seed loading process of glucosinolates identifies barrier-specific targets for transport engineering strategies to eliminate or over-accumulate a specialized metabolite in seeds with minimal interruption of other cellular processes.;,citation_author=Niels Christian Holm Sanden;,citation_author=Christa Kanstrup;,citation_author=Christoph Crocoll;,citation_author=Alexander Schulz;,citation_author=Hussam Hassan Nour-Eldin;,citation_author=Barbara Ann Halkier;,citation_author=Deyang Xu;,citation_publication_date=2024-01;,citation_cover_date=2024-01;,citation_year=2024;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1038/s41477-023-01598-4;,citation_issn=2055-0278;,citation_volume=10;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Nat.

Lignin synthesis initiates through oxidative radical-radical coupling of monolignols, the most common of which are p-coumaryl, coniferyl, and sinapyl alcohols. Here, we use density functional theory to characterize radical-radical coupling reactions involved in monolignol dimerization. We compute reaction enthalpies for the initial self- and cross-coupling reactions of these monolignol radicals to form dimeric intermediates via six major linkages observed in natural lignin. The 8-O-4, 8-8, and 8-5 coupling are computed to be the most favorable, whereas the 5-O-4, 5-5, and 8-1 linkages are less favorable. Overall, p-coumaryl self- and cross-coupling reactions are calculated to be the most favorable. For cross-coupling reactions, in which each radical can couple via either of the two sites involved in dimer formation, the more reactive of the two radicals is found to undergo coupling at its site with the highest spin density.;,citation_author=Amandeep K.

We review the experimental and theoretical work on this phenomenon. We then proceed to explore the hypothesis that electrokinetic effects in the bordered pit membrane (BPM) contribute to this response. In particular, we develop a model based on electroviscosity in which hydraulic conductance of an electrically charged porous membrane varies with the properties of the electrolyte. We use standard electrokinetic theory, coupled with measurements of electrokinetic properties of plant materials from the literature, to determine how the conductance of BPMs, and therefore , may change due to electroviscosity. We predict a nonmonotonic variation of with with a maximum reduction of 18%. We explore how this reduction depends on the characteristics of the sap and features of the BPM, such as pore size, density of chargeable sites, and their dissociation constant. Our predictions are consistent with changes in observed for physiological values of sap and pH. We conclude that electroviscosity is likely responsible, at least partially, for the electrolyte dependence of conductance through pits and that electroviscosity may be strong enough to play an important role in other transport processes in xylem.

It was found that coniferyl alcohol radical transferred quickly to sinapyl alcohol. The transfer to syringaresinol was slower, however, the transfer to polymeric lignols occurred very slightly. This result suggests that the radical mediator theory does not sufficiently explain the mechanism for dehydrogenative polymerization of lignin. A cationic cell wall peroxidase (CWPO-C) from poplar (Populus alba L.) callus showed a strong substrate preference for sinapyl alcohol and the sinapyl alcohol dimer, syringaresinol. Moreover, CWPO-C was capable of oxidizing high-molecular-weight sinapyl alcohol polymers and ferrocytochrome c. Therefore, the CWPO-C characteristics are important to produce polymer lignin.

Five of them (Lacl-5) were isolated from cDNA libraries derived from differentiating xylem through a cDNA sequenc-ing project in loblolly pine xylem (Allona et a/. 1998) and other three (Lac6-8) were isolated using a probe from a tobacco blue copper oxidase. Analysis of the cDNAs revealed that the proteins predicted had N-terminal signal sequences, 8-21 glycosylation sites, and four copper binding sites. The putative mature laccases range between 59.2 and 61.7 kD. The predicted isoelectric points vary between 7.3 and 9.9. Phylogenetic analysis shows these laccase cDNAs form three clusters in the cationic plant laccase group. Northern analysis indicated that all eight of the laccase transcripts are most abundant in differentiating xylem of the six tissues and organs tested. The Lac1 transcript is also detectable in immature pollen cones, and the Lac 7 transcript is detectable in several organs tested.

At the non-permissive temperature of 31^\circC, the mutation impaired tissue elongation; otherwise, tissue development was normal. Hypocotyl cells that had established cell walls at 21^\circC under light-dark cycles ceased elongation and swelled when the mutant was shifted to 31^\circC and darkness, indicating that the affected gene is essential for cell elongation. Analysis of the cell walls of mutant plants grown at 31^\circC revealed that the cellulose content was reduced to 40% and the pectin content was increased to 162% of the corresponding values for the wild type grown at the same temperature. The increased amounts of pectin in the mutant were bound tightly to cellulose microfibrils. No change in the content of hemicellulose was apparent in the 31^\circC-adapted mutant. Field emission–scanning electron microscopy suggested that the structure of cellulose bundles was affected by the mutation; X-ray diffraction, however, revealed no change in the crystallite size of cellulose microfibrils. The regeneration of cellulose microfibrils from naked mutant protoplasts was substantially delayed at 31^\circC. The recessive mutation was mapped to chromosome V, and map-based cloning identified it as a single G\rightarrowA transition (resulting in a Gly429\rightarrowArg substitution) in KORRIGAN, which encodes a putative membrane-bound endo-1,4-\beta-glucanase.

The ZPO-C transcript was shown to accumulate transiently at the time of secondary wall thickening of TEs in xylogenic culture of Zinnia cells. In situ hybridization indicated specific accumulation of the ZPO-C transcript in immature vessels in Zinnia seedlings. Immunohistochemical analysis using anti-ZPO-C antibody showed that the ZPO-C protein is abundant in TEs, especially at their secondary walls.

The ZPO-C:6 x His protein had a peroxidase activity preferring sinapyl alcohol as well as coniferyl alcohol as a substrate, with a narrow pH optimum around 5.25.

Recently, bmr6 plants were shown to have limited cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase activity (CAD; EC 1.1.1.195), the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of hydroxycinnamoyl aldehydes (monolignals) to monolignols. A candidate gene approach was taken to identify Bmr6. Two CAD genes (Sb02g024190 and Sb04g005950) were identified in the sorghum genome based on similarity to known CAD genes and through DNA sequencing a nonsense mutation was discovered in Sb04g005950 that results in a truncated protein lacking the NADPH-binding and C-terminal catalytic domains. Immunoblotting confirmed that the Bmr6 protein was absent in protein extracts from bmr6 plants. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that Bmr6 is a member of an evolutionarily conserved group of CAD proteins, which function in lignin biosynthesis. In addition, Bmr6 is distinct from the other CAD-like proteins in sorghum, including SbCAD4 (Sb02g024190). Although both Bmr6 and SbCAD4 are expressed in sorghum internodes, an examination of enzymatic activity of recombinant Bmr6 and SbCAD4 showed that Bmr6 had 1 to 2 orders of magnitude greater activity for monolignol substrates. Modeling of Bmr6 and SbCAD4 protein structures showed differences in the amino acid composition of the active site that could explain the difference in enzyme activity. These differences include His-57, which is unique to Bmr6 and other grass CADs. In summary, Bmr6 encodes the major CAD protein involved in lignin synthesis in sorghum, and the bmr6 mutant is a null allele.;,citation_author=Scott E. Sattler;,citation_author=Aaron J.

These changes were followed separately for the apoplast and for the symplast. The growth and blossoming of catkins was paralleled by a prominent resynthesis of starch (e.g. from 3.0 to 7.7 mg-1 dwt) and a great decrease of sugars in the symplast (e.g. from 20.2 to 6.4 gmg-1 dwt), a remarkable release of sugars into the apoplast (maximum content 8.98 gl-1), a steep rise in transpiration, and a sharp drop in the pH of the xylem sap (e.g. from 7.5 to 5.7). In the symplast, the ratio of starch to sugars changed from ca. 1:6 to 1:1 within 10 days while its sugar content decreased from 0.65 M to 0.2 M. During catkin growth and blossoming, the carbohydrate content of the branch wood decreased by about 50%.

The CYP73A subfamily of plant P450s catalyzes trans-cinnamic acid 4-hydroxylation, the second step of the general phenylpropanoid pathway. We show that when incubated in vitro with yeast-expressed CYP73A1, PA behaves as a potent mechanism-based and quasi-irreversible inactivator of trans-cinnamate 4-hydroxylase. Inactivation requires NADPH, is time dependent and saturable (K I = 17 \mum,k inact = 0.064 min-1), and results from the formation of a stable metabolite-P450 complex absorbing at 427 nm. The formation of this complex is reversible with substrate or other strong ligands of the enzyme. In plant microsomes PA seems to selectively inactivate the CYP73A P450 subpopulation. It does not form detectable complexes with other recombinant plant P450 enzymes.

Furthermore, the selective breakdown of regulatory proteins by the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway controls key aspects of plant growth, development, and defense. Proteases are, on the other hand, also responsible for the post-translational modification of proteins by limited proteolysis at highly specific sites. Limited proteolysis results in the maturation of enzymes, is necessary for protein assembly and subcellular targeting, and controls the activity of enzymes, regulatory proteins and peptides.

The actin cytoskeleton has a direct impact on the control of cell size in animal cells, but its mechanistic contribution to cellular growth in plants remains largely elusive. Here, we reveal a role of actin in regulating cell size in plants. The actin cytoskeleton shows proximity to vacuoles, and the phytohormone auxin not only controls the organization of actin filaments but also impacts vacuolar morphogenesis in an actin-dependent manner. Pharmacological and genetic interference with the actin–myosin system abolishes the effect of auxin on vacuoles and thus disrupts its negative influence on cellular growth. SEM-based 3D nanometer-resolution imaging of the vacuoles revealed that auxin controls the constriction and luminal size of the vacuole. We show that this actin-dependent mechanism controls the relative vacuolar occupancy of the cell, thus suggesting an unanticipated mechanism for cytosol homeostasis during cellular growth.;,citation_author=David Scheuring;,citation_author=Christian Löfke;,citation_author=Falco Krüger;,citation_author=Maike Kittelmann;,citation_author=Ahmed Eisa;,citation_author=Louise Hughes;,citation_author=Richard S.

Although the second enzyme of this pathway, cinnamic acid 4-hydroxylase (C4H), is well characterized, a mutant for the gene encoding this enzyme has not yet, to our knowledge, been identified, presumably because knock-out mutations in this gene would have severe phenotypes. This work describes the characterization of an allelic series of Arabidopsis reduced epidermal fluorescence 3 (ref3) mutants, each of which harbor mis-sense mutations in C4H (At2g30490). Heterologous expression of the mutant proteins in Escherichia coli yields enzymes that exhibit P420 spectra, indicative of mis-folded proteins, or have limited ability to bind substrate, indicating that the mutations we have identified affect protein stability and/or enzyme function. In agreement with the early position of C4H in phenylpropanoid metabolism, ref3 mutant plants accumulate decreased levels of several different classes of phenylpropanoid end-products, and exhibit reduced lignin deposition and altered lignin monomer content. Furthermore, these plants accumulate a novel hydroxycinnamic ester, cinnamoylmalate, which is not found in the wild type. The decreased C4H activity in ref3 also causes pleiotropic phenotypes, including dwarfism, male sterility and the development of swellings at branch junctions. Together, these observations indicate that C4H function is critical to the normal biochemistry and development of Arabidopsis.;,citation_author=Anthony L.

To gain insights into the secretion of cellular clotting factors, we created tagged versions of three different clotting factors. Our focus was on factors which are released in a non-classical manner and to characterize them in comparison to a protein that is classically released, namely Glutactin (Glt). Transglutaminase-A (Tg) and Prophenoloxidase 2 (PPO2), both of which lack signal peptide sequences, have been previously demonstrated to be released from plasmatocytes and crystal cells (CCs) respectively, the two hemocyte classes in naïve larvae. We found that at the molecular level, Tg secretion resembles the release of tissue transglutaminase in mammals. Specifically, Drosophila Tg is associated with vesicular membranes and remains membrane-bound after release, in contrast to Glt, which we found localizes to a different class of vesicles and is integrated into clot fibers. PPO2 on the other hand, is set free from CCs through cytolysis. We confirm that PPO2 is a central component of the cytosolic crystals and find that the distribution of PPO2 appears to vary across crystals and cells.

Xylem 29 vessels are solute-transporting elements in the vasculature that possess secondary wall thickenings 30 deposited in intricate patterns. Evenly dispersed microtubule (MT) bands support the formation of 31 these wall thickenings, but how the MTs direct cell wall synthesis during this process remains largely 32 unknown. Cellulose is the major secondary wall constituent and is synthesized by plasma membrane-33 localized cellulose synthases (CesAs) whose catalytic activity propels them through the membrane. 34 We show that the protein CELLULOSE SYNTHASE INTERACTING (CSI)1/POM2 is necessary to 35 align the secondary wall CesAs and MTs during the initial phase of xylem vessel development in 36 Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa (rice). Surprisingly, these MT-driven patterns successively 37 become imprinted and sufficient to sustain the continued progression of wall thickening in the 38 absence of MTs and CSI1/POM2 function. Hence, two complementary principles underpin wall 39 patterning during xylem vessel development.;,citation_author=Rene Schneider;,citation_author=Lu Tang;,citation_author=Edwin R Lampugnani;,citation_author=Sarah Barkwill;,citation_author=Rahul Lathe;,citation_author=Yi Zhang;,citation_author=Heather E.

Cortical microtubules direct wall deposition and need to rapidly re-organize during xylem cell development. Here, we establish long-term live-cell imaging of single Arabidopsis cells undergoing proto-xylem trans-differentiation, resulting in spiral wall patterns, to understand microtubule re-organization. We find that the re-organization requires local microtubule de-stabilization in band-interspersing gaps. Using microtubule simulations, we recapitulate the process in silico and predict that spatio-temporal control of microtubule nucleation is critical for pattern formation, which we confirm in vivo. By combining simulations and live-cell imaging we further explain how the xylem wall-deficient and microtubule-severing KATANIN contributes to microtubule and wall patterning. Hence, by combining quantitative microscopy and modelling we devise a framework to understand how microtubule re-organization supports wall patterning.;,citation_author=René Schneider;,citation_author=Kris Klooster;,citation_author=Kelsey L.

In mammalian cells, molecular assemblies residing at the interface of the cell membrane and the extracellular matrix play an important role in perceiving and transmitting external mechanical signals to trigger physiological responses. Similar processes occur in plants, but there is little understanding of the molecular mechanisms and their genetic basis. Here, we show that the number and movement directions of cellulose synthase complexes (CSCs) at the plasma membrane vary during initial stages of development in the cotyledon epidermis of Arabidopsis, closely mirroring the microtubule organization. Uncoupling microtubules and CSCs resulted in enhanced microtubule co-alignment as caused by mechanical stimuli driven either by cell shape or by tissue-scale physical perturbations. Furthermore, micromechanical perturbation resulted in depletion of CSCs from the plasma membrane, suggesting a possible link between cellulose synthase removal from the plasma membrane and microtubule response to mechanical stimuli. Taken together, our results suggest that the interaction of cellulose synthase with cortical microtubules forms a physical continuum between the cell wall, plasma membrane and the cytoskeleton that modulates the mechano-response of the cytoskeleton.;,citation_author=René Schneider;,citation_author=David W.

Here we show that, in root hairs, the RALF22 peptide has a dual structural and signaling role in cell expansion. Together with LRX1, it directs the compaction of charged pectin polymers at the root hair tip into periodic circumferential rings. Free RALF22 induces the formation of a complex with LORELEI-LIKE-GPI-ANCHORED PROTEIN 1 (LLG1) and FERONIA (FER), triggering adaptive cellular responses.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Laccases Direct Lignification in the Discrete Secondary Cell Wall Domains of Protoxylem;,citation_abstract=Plants precisely control lignin deposition in spiral or annular secondary cell wall domains during protoxylem tracheary element (TE) development. Because protoxylem TEs function to transport water within rapidly elongating tissues, it is important that lignin deposition is restricted to the secondary cell walls in order to preserve the plasticity of adjacent primary wall domains. The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) inducible VASCULAR NAC DOMAIN7 (VND7) protoxylem TE differentiation system permits the use of mutant backgrounds, fluorescent protein tagging, and high-resolution live-cell imaging of xylem cells during secondary cell wall development. Enzymes synthesizing monolignols, as well as putative monolignol transporters, showed a uniform distribution during protoxylem TE differentiation. By contrast, the oxidative enzymes LACCASE4 (LAC4) and LAC17 were spatially localized to secondary cell walls throughout protoxylem TE differentiation. These data support the hypothesis that precise delivery of oxidative enzymes determines the pattern of cell wall lignification. This view was supported by lac4lac17 mutant analysis demonstrating that laccases are necessary for protoxylem TE lignification. Overexpression studies showed that laccases are sufficient to catalyze ectopic lignin polymerization in primary cell walls when exogenous monolignols are supplied. Our data support a model of protoxylem TE lignification in which monolignols are highly mobile once exported to the cell wall, and in which precise targeting of laccases to secondary cell wall domains directs lignin deposition.;,citation_author=M.

Models were developed from images of pits in roots and stems of Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP. A computational solid mechanics approach was utilised to determine the extent of torus deflection from pressure applied to the torus and margo. Torus deflection increased in nonlinear fashion with applied pressure. The average pressure required for sealing the pit was 0.894 MPa for stems and 0.644 MPa for roots, although considerable variation was apparent between individual pits. The pits of roots were wider and deeper than those of stems. For stems, the pit depth did not increase with pit width; thus the torus displacement needed to seal the pit was less than for pits from roots. The pressure required to seal the pit depends upon anatomical characteristics such as pit width and pit depth. Although the torus displacement for sealing was greater for roots because of their greater depth, the pressures leading to sealing were not significantly different between roots and stems.;,citation_author=Paul J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Plant leucine aminopeptidases moonlight as molecular chaperones to alleviate stress-induced damage;,citation_abstract=Leucine aminopeptidases (LAPs) are present in animals, plants, and microbes. In plants, there are two classes of LAPs. The neutral LAPs (LAP-N and its orthologs) are constitutively expressed and detected in all plants, whereas the stress-induced acidic LAPs (LAP-A) are expressed only in a subset of the Solanaceae. LAPs have a role in insect defense and act as a regulator of the late branch of wound signaling in Solanum lycopersicum (tomato). Although the mechanism of LAP-A action is unknown, it has been presumed that LAP peptidase activity is essential for regulating wound signaling. Here we show that plant LAPs are bifunctional. Using three assays to monitor protein protection from heat-induced damage, it was shown that the tomato LAP-A and LAP-N and the Arabidopsis thaliana LAP1 and LAP2 are molecular chaperones. Assays using LAP-A catalytic site mutants demonstrated that LAP-A chaperone activity was independent of its peptidase activity. Furthermore, disruption of the LAP-A hexameric structure increased chaperone activity.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Overexpression of SbMyb60 impacts phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and alters secondary cell wall composition in Sorghum bicolor;,citation_abstract=The phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway that generates lignin subunits represents a significant target for altering the abundance and composition of lignin. The global regulators of phenylpropanoid metabolism may include MYB transcription factors, whose expression levels have been correlated with changes in secondary cell wall composition and the levels of several other aromatic compounds, including anthocyanins and flavonoids. While transcription factors correlated with downregulation of the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway have been identified in several grass species, few transcription factors linked to activation of this pathway have been identified in C4 grasses, some of which are being developed as dedicated bioenergy feedstocks. In this study we investigated the role of SbMyb60 in lignin biosynthesis in sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), which is a drought-tolerant, high-yielding biomass crop. Ectopic expression of this transcription factor in sorghum was associated with higher expression levels of genes involved in monolignol biosynthesis, and led to higher abundances of syringyl lignin, significant compositional changes to the lignin polymer and increased lignin concentration in biomass. Moreover, transgenic plants constitutively overexpressing SbMyb60 also displayed ectopic lignification in leaf midribs and elevated concentrations of soluble phenolic compounds in biomass. Results indicate that overexpression of SbMyb60 is associated with activation of monolignol biosynthesis in sorghum. SbMyb60 represents a target for modification of plant cell wall composition, with the potential to improve biomass for renewable uses.;,citation_author=Erin D.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Membrane-bound transcription factors in plants;,citation_abstract=The ability to activate dormant transcription factors is an important molecular feature of the transcriptional regulatory networks that govern diverse cellular functions. An intriguing example is the controlled proteolytic activation of membrane-bound transcription factors (MTFs). Most MTFs are activated either by intramembrane proteases or by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Recent studies have shown that several members of the bZIP and NAC families in Arabidopsis are membrane-associated and are activated by membrane-associated proteases during stress responses in the endoplasmic reticulum and when the plants experience environmental stresses. A genome-scale analysis shows that over 10% of all transcription factors are membrane bound, indicating that activation of MTFs occurs at the genomic level, allowing transcription to be regulated rapidly under stressful conditions. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The concentration of melanins (10%) and the potential scan rate (10-4 V s-1) were chosen in ranges for which there is a linear relationship between these parameters and the current peak intensity. In these thin-layer conditions, the voltammogram of eumelanins at pH 5.6 reveals two main peaks in oxidation at +460 and +525 mV versus SCE and in reduction at +20 and -355 mV versus SCE. No variation of peak potential was observed when the pH was varied in the range 2-8. An average of two electrons (three for the first oxidation scan) were exchanged in these redox processes whereas the number of subunits in one molecule of melanin was around 15 as found by MALDI mass spectroscopy experiments.

Previously, we have identified and characterized a thermo-tolerant copper-zinc superoxide dismutase from Potentilla atrosanguinea (PaSOD), which retains its activity in the presence of NaCl. In the present study, we show that cotyledonary explants of PaSOD overexpressing transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana exhibit early callus induction and high shoot regenerative capacity than wild-type (WT) explants. Growth kinetic studies showed that transgenic lines have 2.6–3.3-folds higher growth rate of calli compared to WT. Regeneration frequency of calli developed from transgenic cotyledons was found to be 1.5–2.5-folds higher than that of WT explants on Murashige and Skoog medium supplemented with different concentrations of naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) and 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) within 2&nbsp;weeks. A positive regulatory effect of PaSOD and H2O2 was observed on different stages of callusing and regeneration. However, this effect was more pronounced at the early stages of the regeneration processes in transgenic lines as compared to WT. These results clearly indicate that plant regeneration is regulated by endogenous H2O2 and by factors, which enhance its accumulation. Transgenics also exhibited salt stress tolerance with higher SOD activity, chlorophyll content, total soluble sugars, and proline content, while lower ion leakage and less reduction in relative water content, as compared to WT. Thus, it appears that the activation of PaSOD at regeneration stage accompanied by increased H2O2 production can be one of the mechanisms controlling in vitro morphogenesis.;,citation_author=Amrina Shafi;,citation_author=Tejpal Gill;,citation_author=Yelam Sreenivasulu;,citation_author=Sanjay Kumar;,citation_author=Paramvir Singh Ahuja;,citation_author=Anil Kumar Singh;,citation_publication_date=2015-01;,citation_cover_date=2015-01;,citation_year=2015;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1007/s00709-014-0653-9;,citation_issn=1615-6102;,citation_volume=252;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Protoplasma;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Evidence for Lignin–Carbohydrate Complexes from Studies of Transgenic Switchgrass and a Model Lignin–Pectin Composite;,citation_abstract=Lignin–carbohydrate complexes (LCCs) form through interactions of lignin with plant cell wall polysaccharides and are thought to be a significant source of biomass recalcitrance. In this work, we investigated LCCs formed between lignin and pectin homogalacturonan (HG). The structural changes in HG deficient transgenic switchgrass (GAUT4-knockdown, GAUT4-KD) after hot water pretreatment were compared to wild-type plants using small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), which showed that there were \sim2.2-fold more lignin aggregates in GAUT4-KD biomass compared to the wild type. This demonstrated that decreased pectin resulted in more lignin redistribution and suggested that interactions between lignin and HG restrict lignin mobility in plant cell walls. To better understand the types of interactions between lignin and pectin, a model composite was prepared by polymerizing either protiated or partially deuterated coniferyl alcohol to form a dehydrogenation polymer (DHP) in the presence of HG. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) showed that the DHP and HG form a highly interconnected network structure that is not observed in a physical mixture of the individual polymers. Contrast matching SANS revealed the structure of DHP and HG in the composite and showed that the HG forms a swollen interconnected polymer network (power-law exponent, P = 1.5) interspersed with DHP particles (radius of gyration, Rg, 264 Å) that are composed of solvent-accessible DHP polymers (P = 2.3). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed a unique ester absorption band in the DHP/HG composites. Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis also supports interactions between DHP and HG. Overall, this study provides new insights into the relationship between primary and secondary cell wall polymers during cell wall synthesis and how LCCs formed between pectin and lignin could represent a previously unrecognized source of biomass recalcitrance.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Biochemistry and biosynthesis of insect pigments;,citation_abstract=The functional role and commercial importance of insect pigments have been studied for well over a century. They are clas- sified into those synthesized by insects, which include anthraquinones, aphins, pterins, tetrapyrroles, ommochromes, melanins and papiliochromes, and those sequestered from their host plants, the antioxidative carotenoids and water-soluble flavonoids. They can also be categorized into those that are produced by cyclization of linear precursors, e.g. anthraquinones, aphins and tetrapyrroles and those derived from cyclic precursors such as pterins, ommochromes, melanins and anthocyanins. Anthraquinones and aphins are derived by cyclization of linear polyketides via successive condensation of simple carboxylic acid metabolites and occur in two major Superfami- lies of Hemiptera, the Coccoidea and Aphidoidae, respectively. Ommochromes, tetrapyrroles and melanins are derived from different amino acid precursors, tryptophan, glycine and tyrosine, respectively. Apart from providing body colouration, ommochromes are visual pigments, melanins act as a protectant against UV and tetrapyrroles facilitate oxygen transport to cells. Papiliochromes are synthesized using both, the essential amino acids tyrosine and tryptophan. Pterins are derived from guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and are also present in ommatidia of eyes. The sequestered pigments, anthocyanins and carotenoids, are synthesized from phenylalanine and by condensation of two isoprene units, respectively, in plants. The biosyntheses of chemochromes in insects are governed by a complex set of enzymes, pathways and genetics. This review provides a comprehensive understanding of the molecules that are not only respon- sible for the striking colours but also provide functional benefits for insects.

Here, transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) were engineered to target and disrupt the OsBADH2 gene. Six heterozygous mutants (30%) were recovered from 20 transgenic hygromycin-resistant lines. Sanger sequencing confirmed that these lines had various indel mutations at the TALEN target site. All six transmitted the BADH2 mutations to the T1 generation; and four T1 mutant lines tested also efficiently transmitted the mutations to the T2 generation. Mutant plants carrying only the desired DNA sequence change but not the TALEN transgene were obtained by segregation in the T1 and T2 generations. The 2AP content of rice grains of the T1 lines with homozygous mutations increased from 0 to 0.35-0.75&nbsp;mg/kg, which was similar to the content of a positive control variety harbouring the badh2-E7 mutation.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Dehydrogenative polymerization of conifery alcohol on macromolecular lignin templates;,citation_abstract=Lignins, the aromatic biopolymers present in all vascular plant cell walls, may embody as many as 10 different linkages between the constituent (p-hydroxyphenyl)propane residues. The final step in lignin biosynthesis has traditionally been thought to involve the random coupling of radical intermediates produced during the dehydrogenative polymerization of monolignol precursors. However, the enzyme-catalysed dehydropolymerization of coniferyl alcohol in homogeneous solution has now been found to be strongly affected by small quantities of macromolecular lignin components. Under these circumstances, when the radical concentrations remained low, the molecular weight distributions of the dehydropolymerisates formed with horseradish peroxidase and H2O2 exhibited dramatic increases in the populations of the largest species. The phenomenon was not suppressed by prior methylation of the aromatic hydroxyl groups on the causative lignin macromolecules—which, therefore, were able to promote the formation of large covalent species from the monolignol without direct participation in radical coupling. If operative in lignifying tissues, such an effect could provide the organization necessary for replicating sequences of interunit linkages along macromolecular lignin chains. In this regard, the enzyme-catalysed dehydropolymerization of coniferyl alcohol would display the character of a typical template polymerization reaction. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

DOPE is based on an improved reference state that corresponds to noninteracting atoms in a homogeneous sphere with the radius dependent on a sample native structure; it thus accounts for the finite and spherical shape of the native structures. The DOPE potential was extracted from a nonredundant set of 1472 crystallographic structures. We tested DOPE and five other scoring functions by the detection of the native state among six multiple target decoy sets, the correlation between the score and model error, and the identification of the most accurate non-native structure in the decoy set.

Lignin content correlates negatively with sugar release efficiency in switchgrass, but selecting the right gene candidates for engineering lignin biosynthesis in this tetraploid outcrossing species is not straightforward. To assist this endeavor, we have used an inducible switchgrass cell suspension system for studying lignin biosynthesis in response to exogenous brassinolide. By applying a combination of protein sequence phylogeny with whole-genome microarray analyses of induced cell cultures and developing stem internode sections, we have generated a list of candidate monolignol biosynthetic genes for switchgrass. Several genes that were strongly supported through our bioinformatics analysis as involved in lignin biosynthesis were confirmed by gene silencing studies, in which lignin levels were reduced as a result of targeting a single gene. However, candidate genes encoding enzymes involved in the early steps of the currently accepted monolignol biosynthesis pathway in dicots may have functionally redundant paralogues in switchgrass and therefore require further evaluation.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Isolation and characterization of spinach photosystem II membrane- associated catalase and polyphenol oxidase;,citation_abstract=Photosystem II (PSII) membranes exhibit catalase and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activities. Mild heat treatment of PSII membranes for 90 min at 30 degrees C releases most of these enzyme activities into the supernatant, accompanied by a 7-fold activation of PPO. In contrast, mild heat treatment of thylakoid membranes does not release significant amounts of either activity, indicating that both enzymes are bound to the luminal surface of the thylakoid membrane. The heat-released PSII membrane-associated catalase and PPO have been purified and characterized. Catalase activity was correlated with a 63 kDa polypeptide which was purified by batch adsorption to anion-exchange beads followed by gel filtration. The PSII membrane-associated catalase is unstable in solution, probably due to irreversible aggregation. The enzyme was characterized in terms of molecular and subunit size, amino-acid composition, UV-visible absorption, heme content, pH optimum, inhibitor sensitivity, and K(m) value for H2O2. Its properties indicate that the PSII membrane-associated catalase is a luminal thylakoid membrane-bound heme enzyme that has not been identified previously. The residual catalase activity of PSII membranes after mild heat treatment is irreversibly inhibited with 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole, a specific inhibitor of heme catalases, without inhibition of O2-evolution activity. This result indicates that little, if any, of the catalase activity from PSII membranes in the dark is catalyzed by the O2-evolving center of PSII. PPO activity was correlated with a 48 kDa polypeptide. However, the 48 kDa polypeptide and another heat-released polypeptide of 72 kDa have the same N-terminal sequence, which is also identical to that of a known 64 kDa protein [Hind, G., Marshak, D. R., &amp;amp;amp; Coughlan, S. J. (1995) Biochemistry 34, 8157-8164]. During heat treatment of PSII membranes and further manipulations it was found that the 72 kDa polypeptide was largely converted into the 48 kDa polypeptide. Thus, the 72 kDa polypeptide appears to be a latent precursor of the active 48 kDa PPO. The PSII membrane-associated PPO was purified by anion-exchange chromatography and was characterized in terms of substrate specificity, pH optimum, inhibitor sensitivity and native molecular weight. The heat-released PPO appears to be identical to the enzyme previously isolated from spinach thylakoid membranes [Golbeck, J. H., &amp; Cammarata, K. V.

All but two species of the angiosperms surveyed possessed the enzyme. The Mr as determined by semi-native electrophoretic mobility, ranged widely from 30 000 to 200 000, depending upon species. All species with PPO activity measured by spectrophotometric or gel assay had cytochemically-detected activity localized to the thylakoid membranes, with cytochemical product accumulating in the lumen of the thylakoid. © 1991.;,citation_author=Timothy D.

We analyzed the transcriptomes of five tissues (xylem, phloem, shoot, leaf, and root) and two wood forming cell types (fiber and vessel) of Populus trichocarpa to assemble gene co-expression subnetworks associated with wood formation. We identified 165 transcription factors (TFs) that showed xylem-, fiber-, and vessel-specific expression. Of these 165 TFs, 101 co-expressed (correlation coefficient, r &amp;amp;gt; 0.7) with the 45 secondary cell wall cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin biosynthetic genes. Each cell wall component gene co-expressed on average with 34 TFs, suggesting redundant control of the cell wall component gene expression. Co-expression analysis showed that the 101 TFs and the 45 cell wall component genes each has two distinct groups (groups 1 and 2), based on their co-expression patterns. The group 1 TFs (44 members) are predominantly xylem and fiber specific, and are all highly positively co-expressed with the group 1 cell wall component genes (30 members), suggesting their roles as major wood formation regulators. Group 1 TFs include a lateral organ boundary domain gene (LBD) that has the highest number of positively correlated cell wall component genes (36) and TFs (47). The group 2 TFs have 57 members, including 14 vessel-specific TFs, and are generally less correlated with the cell wall component genes. An exception is a vessel-specific basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) gene that negatively correlates with 20 cell wall component genes, and may function as a key transcriptional suppressor.

Cationic cell-wall-bound peroxidase (CWPO-C) from poplar callus is a unique enzyme that has oxidative activity for both monolignols and synthetic lignin polymers. This study shows that putative CWPO-C homologues in Arabidopsis , AtPrx2, AtPrx25, and AtPrx71, are involved in lignin biosynthesis. Analysis of stem tissue using the acetyl bromide method and derivatization followed by the reductive cleavage method revealed a significant decrease in the total lignin content of ATPRX2 and ATPRX25 deficient mutants and altered lignin structures in ATPRX2, ATPRX25, and ATPRX71 deficient mutants. Among Arabidopsis peroxidases, AtPrx2 and AtPrx25 conserve a tyrosine residue on the protein surface, and this tyrosine may act as a substrate oxidation site as in the case of CWPO-C. AtPrx71 has the highest amino acid identity with CWPO-C.

Whereas plant peroxidases have been shown to catalyze oxidative coupling of monolignols, the oxidation activity of well-studied plant peroxidases, such as horseradish peroxidase C (HRP-C) and AtPrx53, are quite low for sinapyl alcohol. This characteristic difference has led to controversy regarding the oxidation mechanism of sinapyl alcohol and lignin oligomers and polymers by plant peroxidases. The present study explored the oxidation activities of three plant peroxidases, AtPrx2, AtPrx25, and AtPrx71, which have been already shown to be involved in lignification in the Arabidopsis stem. Recombinant proteins of these peroxidases (rAtPrxs) were produced in Escherichia coli as inclusion bodies and successfully refolded to yield their active forms. rAtPrx2, rAtPrx25, and rAtPrx71 were found to oxidize two syringyl compounds (2,6-dimethoxyphenol and syringaldazine), which were employed here as model monolignol compounds, with higher specific activities than HRP-C and rAtPrx53. Interestingly, rAtPrx2 and rAtPrx71 oxidized syringyl compounds more efficiently than guaiacol. Moreover, assays with ferrocytochrome c as a substrate showed that AtPrx2, AtPrx25, and AtPrx71 possessed the ability to oxidize large molecules.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Determination of glucose and ethanol after enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation of biomass using Raman spectroscopy;,citation_abstract=Raman spectroscopy has been used for the quantitative determination of the conversion efficiency at each step in the production of ethanol from biomass. The method requires little sample preparation; therefore, it is suitable for screening large numbers of biomass samples and reaction conditions in a complex sample matrix. Dilute acid or ammonia-pretreated corn stover was used as a model biomass for these studies. Ammonia pretreatment was suitable for subsequent measurements with Raman spectroscopy, but dilute acid-pretreated corn stover generated a large background signal that surpassed the Raman signal. The background signal is attributed to lignin, which remains in the plant tissue after dilute acid pretreatment. A commercial enzyme mixture was used for the enzymatic hydrolysis of corn stover, and glucose levels were measured with a dispersive 785nm Raman spectrometer. The glucose detection limit in hydrolysis liquor by Raman spectroscopy was 8gL-1. The mean hydrolysis efficiency for three replicate measurements obtained with Raman spectroscopy (864%) was compared to the result obtained using an enzymatic reaction with UV–vis spectrophotometry detection (788%). The results indicate good accuracy, as determined using a Student’s t-test, and better precision for the Raman spectroscopy measurement relative to the enzymatic detection assay. The detection of glucose in hydrolysis broth by Raman spectroscopy showed no spectral interference, provided the sample was filtered to remove insoluble cellulose prior to analysis. The hydrolysate was further subjected to fermentation to yield ethanol. The detection limit for ethanol in fermentation broth by Raman spectroscopy was found to be 6gL-1.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A rapid and non-destructive screenable marker, FAST, for identifying transformed seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana;,citation_abstract=The creation of transgenic plants has contributed extensively to the advancement of plant science. Establishing homozygous transgenic lines is time-consuming and laborious, and using antibiotics or herbicides to select transformed plants may adversely affect the growth of some transgenic plants. Here we describe a novel technology, which we have named FAST (fluorescence-accumulating seed technology), that overcomes these difficulties. Although this technology was designed for use in Arabidopsis thaliana, it may be adapted for use in other plants. The technology is based on the expression of a fluorescent co-dominant screenable marker FAST, under the control of a seed-specific promoter, on the oil body membrane. The FAST marker harbors a fusion gene encoding either GFP or RFP with an oil body membrane protein that is prominent in seeds. The marker protein was only expressed in a specific organ (i.e. in dry seeds) and at a specific time (i.e. during dormancy), which are desirable features of selectable and/or screenable markers. This technique provides an immediate and non-destructive method for identifying transformed dry seeds. It identified the heterozygous transformed seeds among the T1 population and the homozygous seeds among the T2 population with a false-discovery rate of &amp;amp;amp;lt;1%. The FAST marker reduces the length of time required to produce homozygous transgenic lines from 7.5 to 4 months. Furthermore, it does not require sterilization, clean-bench protocols or the handling of large numbers of plants.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Active Transport of Lignin Precursors into Membrane Vesicles from Lignifying Tissues of Bamboo;,citation_abstract=Lignin is the second most abundant natural polymer on Earth and is a major cell wall component in vascular plants. Lignin biosynthesis has three stages: biosynthesis, transport, and polymerization of its precursors. However, there is limited knowledge on lignin precursor transport, especially in monocots. In the present study, we aimed to elucidate the transport mode of lignin monomers in the lignifying tissues of bamboo (Phyllostachys pubescens). The growth manners and lignification processes of bamboo shoots were elucidated, which enabled us to obtain the lignifying tissues reproducibly. Microsomal membrane fractions were prepared from tissues undergoing vigorous lignification to analyze the transport activities of lignin precursors in order to show the ATP-dependent transport of coniferin and p-glucocoumaryl alcohol. The transport activities for both precursors depend on vacuolar type H+-ATPase and a H+ gradient across the membrane, suggesting that the electrochemical potential is the driving force of the transport of both substrates. These findings are similar to the transport properties of these lignin precursors in the differentiating xylem of poplar and Japanese cypress. Our findings suggest that transport of coniferin and p-glucocoumaryl alcohol is mediated by secondary active transporters energized partly by the vacuolar type H+-ATPase, which is common in lignifying tissues.

We have previously shown that the Arabidopsis AGRAVITROPIC 1/PIN2 gene encodes an auxin efflux component regulating root gravitropism and basipetal auxin transport. However, the regulatory mechanism underlying the function of AGR1/PIN2 is largely unknown. Recently, protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation mediated by protein kinases and phosphatases, respectively, have been implicated in regulating polar auxin transport and root gravitropism. Here, we examined the effects of chemical inhibitors of protein phosphatases on root gravitropism and basipetal auxin transport, as well as the expression pattern of AGR1/PIN2 gene and the localization of AGR1/PIN2 protein. We also examined the effects of inhibitors of vesicle trafficking and protein kinases. Our data suggest that protein phosphatases, sensitive to cantharidin and okadaic acid, are likely involved in regulating AGR1/PIN2-mediated root basipetal auxin transport and gravitropism, as well as auxin response in the root central elongation zone (CEZ). BFA-sensitive vesicle trafficking may be required for the cycling of AGR1/PIN2 between plasma membrane and the BFA compartment, but not for the AGR1/PIN2-mediated root basipetal auxin transport and auxin response in CEZ cells.;,citation_author=Heungsop Shin;,citation_author=Hwa-Soo Shin;,citation_author=Zibiao Guo;,citation_author=Elison B.

AM063 and AM380 had 20.2 and 35.5% of Klason lignin content and 59.0 and 48.2%, \alpha-cellulose contents, respectively. We investigated the correlation between wood properties and transcript levels of wood formation-related genes using RNA-seq with total RNAs extracted from developing xylem tissues at a breast height. Transcript levels of cell wall construction genes such as cellulose synthase (CesA) and sucrose synthase (SUSY) were almost the same in both genotypes. However, AM063 exhibited higher transcript levels of UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase and xyloglucan endotransglucoxylase than those in AM380. Most monolignol biosynthesis-related isozyme genes showed higher transcript levels in AM380. These results indicate monolignol biosynthesis-related genes may regulate wood composition in Eucalyptus. Flavonoids contents were also observed at much higher levels in AM380 as a result of the elevated transcript levels of common phenylpropanoid pathway genes, phenylalanine ammonium lyase, cinnamate-4-hydroxylase (C4H) and 4-coumarate-CoA ligase (4CL). Secondary plant cell wall formation is regulated by many transcription factors. We analyzed genes encoding NAC, WRKY, AP2/ERF, and KNOX transcription factors and found higher transcript levels of these genes in AM380. We also observed increased transcription of some MYB and LIM domain transcription factors in AM380 compared to AM063.

In many plant species, including rice (Oryza sativa), the hypodermis in the outer part of roots forms a suberized cell wall (the Casparian strip and/or suberin lamellae), which inhibits the flow of water and ions and protects against pathogens. To date, there is no genetic evidence that suberin forms an apoplastic transport barrier in the hypodermis. We discovered that a rice reduced culm number1 (rcn1) mutant could not develop roots longer than 100 mm in waterlogged soil. The mutated gene encoded an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter named RCN1/OsABCG5. RCN1/OsABCG5 gene expression in the wild type was increased in most hypodermal and some endodermal roots cells under stagnant deoxygenated conditions. A GFP-RCN1/OsABCG5 fusion protein localized at the plasma membrane of the wild type. Under stagnant deoxygenated conditions, well suberized hypodermis developed in wild types but not in rcn1 mutants. Under stagnant deoxygenated conditions, apoplastic tracers (periodic acid and berberine) were blocked at the hypodermis in the wild type but not in rcn1, indicating that the apoplastic barrier in the mutant was impaired. The amount of the major aliphatic suberin monomers originating from C(28) and C(30) fatty acids or \omega-OH fatty acids was much lower in rcn1 than in the wild type.

This work clearly shows that CAD-C and CAD-D act as the primary genes involved in lignin biosynthesis in the floral stem of Arabidopsis thaliana by supplying both coniferyl and sinapyl alcohols. An Arabidopsis CAD double mutant (cad-c cad-d) resulted in a phenotype with a limp floral stem at maturity as well as modifications in the pattern of lignin staining. Lignin content of the mutant stem was reduced by 40%, with a 94% reduction, relative to the wild type, in conventional beta-O-4-linked guaiacyl and syringyl units and incorportion of coniferyl and sinapyl aldehydes. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy demonstrated that both xylem vessels and fibers were affected. GeneChip data and real-time PCR analysis revealed that transcription of CAD homologs and other genes mainly involved in cell wall integrity were also altered in the double mutant. In addition, molecular complementation of the double mutant by tissue-specific expression of CAD derived from various species suggests different abilities of these genes/proteins to produce syringyl-lignin moieties but does not indicate a requirement for any specific SAD gene.;,citation_author=Richard Sibout;,citation_author=Aymerick Eudes;,citation_author=Gregory Mouille;,citation_author=Brigitte Pollet;,citation_author=Catherine Lapierre;,citation_author=Lise Jouanin;,citation_author=Armand Séguin;,citation_publication_date=2005-07;,citation_cover_date=2005-07;,citation_year=2005;,citation_issue=7;,citation_doi=10.1105/tpc.105.030767;,citation_isbn=1040-4651 (Print);,citation_issn=1040-4651;,citation_pmid=15937231;,citation_volume=17;,citation_journal_title=Plant cell;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Structural redesigning Arabidopsis lignins into alkali-soluble lignins through the expression of p-coumaroyl-CoA:monolignol transferase (PMT);,citation_abstract=Grass lignins can contain up to 10% to 15% by weight of p-coumaric esters. This acylation is performed on monolignols under the catalysis of p-coumaroyl-coenzyme A monolignol transferase (PMT). To study the impact of p-coumaroylation on lignification, we first introduced the Brachypodium distachyon Bradi2g36910 (BdPMT1) gene into Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) under the control of the constitutive maize (Zea mays) ubiquitin promoter. The resulting p-coumaroylation was far lower than that of lignins from mature grass stems and had no impact on stem lignin content. By contrast, introducing either the BdPMT1 or the Bradi1g36980 (BdPMT2) gene into Arabidopsis under the control of the Arabidopsis cinnamate-4-hydroxylase promoter boosted the p-coumaroylation of mature stems up to the grass lignin level (8% to 9% by weight), without any impact on plant development. The analysis of purified lignin fractions and the identification of diagnostic products confirmed that p-coumaric acid was associated with lignins. BdPMT1-driven p-coumaroylation was also obtained in the fah1 (deficient for ferulate 5-hydroxylase) and ccr1g (deficient for cinnamoyl-coenzyme A reductase) lines, albeit to a lower extent. Lignins from BdPMT1-expressing ccr1g lines were also found to be feruloylated. In Arabidopsis mature stems, substantial p-coumaroylation of lignins was achieved at the expense of lignin content and induced lignin structural alterations, with an unexpected increase of lignin units with free phenolic groups. This higher frequency of free phenolic groups in Arabidopsis lignins doubled their solubility in alkali at room temperature. These findings suggest that the formation of alkali-leachable lignin domains rich in free phenolic groups is favored when p-coumaroylated monolignols participate in lignification in a grass in a similar manner.;,citation_author=Richard Sibout;,citation_author=Philippe Le Bris;,citation_author=Frédéric Legee;,citation_author=Laurent Cezard;,citation_author=Hugues Renault;,citation_author=Catherine Lapierre;,citation_publication_date=2016;,citation_cover_date=2016;,citation_year=2016;,citation_issue=March;,citation_doi=10.1104/pp.15.01877;,citation_isbn=0000000267571;,citation_issn=0032-0889;,citation_pmid=26826222;,citation_volume=170;,citation_journal_title=Plant Physiol.;">

The ability of feruloyl esterase (from Aspergillus niger) and Mn2+-oxidizing peroxidases (from Phanerochaete chrysosporium and Pleurotus eryngii) to decrease the final lignin content of flax pulp was shown.

However, the best results were obtained when the laccase treatment was performed in the presence of a mediator, 1-hydroxybenzotriazol (HBT), enabling strong delignification of pulps. The enzymatic removal of lignin resulted in high-final brightness values that are difficult to attain by chemical bleaching of this type of pulp. A partial inactivation of laccase by HBT was observed but this negative effect was strongly reduced in the presence of pulp.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Regulation by salt of vacuolar H+-ATPase and H+-pyrophosphatase activities and Na+/H+ exchange.;,citation_abstract=Over the last decades several efforts have been carried out to determine the mechanisms of salt homeostasis in plants and, more recently, to identify genes implicated in salt tolerance, with some plants being successfully genetically engineered to improve resistance to salt. It is well established that the efficient exclusion of Na(+) excess from the cytoplasm and vacuolar Na(+) accumulation are the most important steps towards the maintenance of ion homeostasis inside the cell. Therefore, the vacuole of plant cells plays a pivotal role in the storage of salt. After the identification of the vacuolar Na(+)/H(+) antiporter Nhx1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the first plant Na(+)/H(+) antiporter, AtNHX1, was isolated from Arabidopsis and its overexpression resulted in plants exhibiting increased salt tolerance. Also, the identification of the plasma membrane Na(+)/H(+) exchanger SOS1 and how it is regulated by a protein kinase SOS2 and a calcium binding protein SOS3 were great achievements in the understanding of plant salt resistance. Both tonoplast and plasma membrane antiporters exclude Na+ from the cytosol driven by the proton-motive force generated by the plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase and by the vacuolar membrane H(+)-ATPase and H(+)-pyrophosphatase and it has been shown that the activity of these proteins responds to salinity.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Maize Brittle Stalk2 encodes a COBRA-like protein expressed in early organ development but required for tissue flexibility at maturity;,citation_abstract=The maize (Zea mays) brittle stalk2 (bk2) is a recessive mutant, the aerial parts of which are easily broken. The bk2 phenotype is developmentally regulated and appears 4 weeks after planting, at about the fifth-leaf stage. Before this time, mutants are indistinguishable from wild-type siblings. Afterward, all organs of the bk2 mutants turn brittle, even the preexisting ones, and they remain brittle throughout the life of the plant. Leaf tension assays and bend tests of the internodes show that the brittle phenotype does not result from loss of tensile strength but from loss in flexibility that causes the tissues to snap instead of bend. The Bk2 gene was cloned by a combination of transposon tagging and a candidate gene approach and found to encode a COBRA-like protein similar to rice (Oryza sativa) BC1 and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) COBRA-LIKE4. The outer periphery of the stalk has fewer vascular bundles, and the sclerids underlying the epidermis possess thinner secondary walls. Relative cellulose content is not strictly correlated with the brittle phenotype. Cellulose content in mature zones of bk2 mature stems is lowered by 40% but is about the same as wild type in developing stems. Although relative cellulose content is lowered in leaves after the onset of the brittle phenotype, total wall mass as a proportion of dry mass is either unchanged or slightly increased, indicating a compensatory increase in noncellulosic carbohydrate mass. Fourier transform infrared spectra indicated an increase in phenolic ester content in the walls of bk2 leaves and stems. Total content of lignin is unaffected in bk2 juvenile leaves before or after appearance of the brittle phenotype, but bk2 mature and developing stems are markedly enriched in lignin compared to wild-type stems. Despite increased lignin in bk2 stems, loss of staining with phloroglucinol and ultraviolet autofluorescence is observed in vascular bundles and sclerid layers. Consistent with the infrared analyses, levels of saponifiable hydroxycinnamates are elevated in bk2 leaves and stems. As Bk2 is highly expressed during early development, well before the onset of the brittle phenotype, we propose that Bk2 functions in a patterning of lignin-cellulosic interactions that maintain organ flexibility rather than having a direct role in cellulose biosynthesis.;,citation_author=Anoop Sindhu;,citation_author=Tiffany Langewisch;,citation_author=Anna Olek;,citation_author=Dilbag S.

Although the recent discovery of several bacterial ligninases promises the development of novel biocatalysts, these enzymes have largely been characterized using model substrates: direct evidence for their action on biomass is lacking. Herein, we report the delignification of woody biomass by a small laccase (sLac) from Amycolatopsis sp. 75iv3. Incubation of steam-pretreated poplar (SPP) with sLac enhanced the release of acid-precipitable polymeric lignin (APPL) by ~6-fold, and reduced the amount of acid-soluble lignin by ~15%. NMR spectrometry revealed that the APPL was significantly syringyl-enriched relative to the original material (~16:1 vs. ~3:1), and that sLac preferentially oxidized syringyl units and altered interunit linkage distributions. sLac’s substrate preference among monoaryls was also consistent with this observation. In addition, sLac treatment reduced the molar mass of the APPL by over 50%, as determined by gel-permeation chromatography coupled with multi-angle light scattering. Finally, sLac acted synergistically with a commercial cellulase cocktail to increase glucose production from SPP ~8%.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=X-ray crystal structure and specificity of the plasmodium falciparum malaria aminopeptidase PfM18AAP;,citation_abstract=The malarial aminopeptidases have emerged as promising new drug targets for the development of novel antimalarial drugs. The M18AAP of Plasmodium falciparum malaria is a metallo-aminopeptidase that we show demonstrates a highly restricted specificity for peptides with an N-terminal Glu or Asp residue. Thus, the enzyme may function alongside other aminopeptidases in effecting the complete degradation or turnover of proteins, such as host hemoglobin, which provides a free amino acid pool for the growing parasite. Inhibition of PfM18AAP’s function using antisense RNA is detrimental to the intra-erythrocytic malaria parasite and, hence, it has been proposed as a potential novel drug target. We report the X-ray crystal structure of the PfM18AAP aminopeptidase and reveal its complex dodecameric assembly arranged via dimer and trimer units that interact to form a large tetrahedron shape that completely encloses the 12 active sites within a central cavity. The four entry points to the catalytic lumen are each guarded by 12 large flexible loops that could control substrate entry into the catalytic sites. PfM18AAP thus resembles a proteasomal-like machine with multiple active sites able to degrade peptide substrates that enter the central lumen. The Plasmodium enzyme shows significant structural differences around the active site when compared to recently determined structures of its mammalian and human homologs, which provides a platform from which a rational approach to inhibitor design of new malaria-specific drugs can begin. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

There are three trinuclear copper clusters in the enzyme localized between domains 1 and 2 of each pair of neighbor chains. In this way, a similar geometry of the active site as seen in large laccases is ensured, albeit by different arrangements of domains and protein chains. Three copper ions of type 1 lie close to one another near the surface of the central part of the trimer, and, effectively, a trimeric substrate binding site is formed in their vicinity. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

All these lines displayed deregulated ROS metabolism, which was manifested by an increased H &amp;lt; inf &amp;gt; 2 < /inf > O < inf > 2 < /inf > level in the leaves and shoots, and higher activities of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and catalase (CAT) in the leaves in comparison to the wild-type plants. However, no changes in non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) between the transgenic lines and wild type were observed in the leaves. Moreover, changes in the ROS metabolism in the pad4 transgenic lines positively correlated with wood formation. A higher rate of cell division, decreased tracheid average size and numbers, and increased cell wall thickness were observed. The results presented here suggest that the Populus tremulatremuloidesPAD gene might be involved in the regulation of cellular ROS homeostasis and in the cell division - cell death balance that is associated with wood development. The PHYTOALEXIN DEFICIENT 4 (PAD4) gene is well-known positive regulator of the cell death in Arabidopsis and its function is important in control of integrated abiotic and biotic stress responses. But its function in woody plants is not known. Therefore, we selected transgenic hybrid aspen with reduced or suppressed PAD4 poplar ortholog expression. Our field study demonstrated that the P. tremula x tremuloidesPAD gene might be a negative regulator of the cell death and is involved in the regulation of the cellular ROS signalling homeostasis, wood development and cell wall properties.;,citation_author=Ireneusz Ślesak;,citation_author=Magdalena Szechyńska-Hebda;,citation_author=Halina Fedak;,citation_author=Natalia Sidoruk;,citation_author=Joanna DąBrowska-Bronk;,citation_author=Damian Witoń;,citation_author=Anna Rusaczonek;,citation_author=Andrzej Antczak;,citation_author=Michał Droz˙dz˙ek;,citation_author=Barbara Karpińska;,citation_author=Stanisław Karpiński;,citation_publication_date=2015;,citation_cover_date=2015;,citation_year=2015;,citation_issue=7;,citation_doi=10.1111/pce.12388;,citation_issn=13653040;,citation_volume=38;,citation_journal_title=Plant, Cell Environ.;">

Lignin precursors (monolignols) must be exported to the extracellular matrix where random oxidative coupling produces a complex lignin polymer. The objectives of this study were twofold: to determine the timing of lignification with respect to programmed cell death and to test if nonlignifying xylary parenchyma cells can contribute to the lignification of tracheary elements and fibers. This study demonstrates that lignin deposition is not exclusively a postmortem event, but also occurs prior to programmed cell death. Radiolabeled monolignols were not detected in the cytoplasm or vacuoles of tracheary elements or neighbors. To experimentally define which cells in lignifying tissues contribute to lignification in intact plants, a microRNA against cinnamoyl CoA-reductase1 driven by the promoter from cellulose synthase7 (ProCESA7:miRNA CCR1) was used to silence monolignol biosynthesis specifically in cells developing lignified secondary cell walls. When monolignol biosynthesis in ProCESA7:miRNA CCR1 lines was silenced in the lignifying cells themselves, but not in the neighboring cells, lignin was still deposited in the xylem secondary cell walls.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Engineering monolignol p-coumarate conjugates into Poplar and Arabidopsis lignins;,citation_abstract=Lignin acylation, the decoration of hydroxyls on lignin structural units with acyl groups, is common in many plant species. Monocot lignins are decorated with p-coumarates via the polymerization of monolignol p-coumarate conjugates. The acyltransferase involved in the formation of these conjugates has been identified in a number of model monocot species, but the effect of monolignol p-coumarate conjugates on lignification, and on plant growth and development, has not yet been examined in plants that do not inherently possess p-coumarates on their lignins. The Oryza sativa p-COUMAROYL-CoA MONOLIGNOL TRANSFERASE gene (OsPMT) was introduced into two eudicots, Arabidopsis thaliana and Populus alba x grandidentata, and a series of analytical methods was used to demonstrate the incorporation of the ensuing monolignol p-coumarate conjugates into the lignin of these plants. In poplar, specifically, the addition of these conjugates did not occur at the expense of the naturally incorporated monolignol p-hydroxybenzoates. Plants expressing the PMT transgene can therefore produce monolignol p-coumarate conjugates essentially without competing with the formation of other acylated monolignols and without drastically impacting normal monolignol production.;,citation_author=Rebecca A Smith;,citation_author=Eliana Gonzales-Vigil;,citation_author=Steven D Karlen;,citation_author=Ji-Young Park;,citation_author=Fachuang Lu;,citation_author=Curtis Wilkerson;,citation_author=A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Suppression of CINNAMOYL-CoA REDUCTASE increases the level of monolignol ferulates incorporated into maize lignins;,citation_abstract=Background: The cell wall polymer lignin provides structural support and rigidity to plant cell walls, and therefore to the plant body. However, the recalcitrance associated with lignin impedes the extraction of polysaccharides from the cell wall to make plant-based biofuels and biomaterials. The cell wall digestibility can be improved by introducing labile ester bonds into the lignin backbone that can be easily broken under mild base treatment at room temperature. The FERULOYL-CoA MONOLIGNOL TRANSFERASE (FMT) enzyme, which may be naturally found in many plants, uses feruloyl-CoA and monolignols to synthesize the ester-linked monolignol ferulate conjugates. A mutation in the first lignin-specific biosynthetic enzyme, CINNAMOYL-CoA REDUCTASE (CCR), results in an increase in the intracellular pool of feruloyl-CoA. Results: Maize (Zea mays) has a native putative FMT enzyme, and its ccr mutants produce an increased pool of feruloyl-CoA that can be used for conversion to monolignol ferulate conjugates. The decreased lignin content and monomers did not, however, impact the plant growth or biomass. The increase in monolignol conjugates correlated with an improvement in the digestibility of maize stem rind tissue. Conclusions: Together, increased monolignol ferulates and improved digestibility in ccr1 mutant plants suggests that they may be superior biofuel crops.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Defining the Diverse Cell Populations Contributing to Lignification in Arabidopsis Stems;,citation_abstract=Many land plants evolved tall and sturdy growth habits due to specialized cells with thick lignified cell walls: tracheary elements that function in water transport and fibers that function in structural support. The objective of this study was to define how and when diverse cell populations contribute lignin precursors, monolignols, to secondary cell walls during lignification of the Arabidopsis inflorescence stem. Previous work demonstrated that, when lignin biosynthesis is suppressed in fiber and tracheary element cells with thickened walls, fibers become lignin-depleted while vascular bundles still lignify, suggesting that non-lignifying neighboring xylem cells are contributing to lignification. In this work, we dissect the contributions of different cell types, specifically xylary parenchyma and fiber cells, to lignification of the stem using cell-type-specific promoters to either knockdown an essential monolignol biosynthetic gene or to introduce novel monolignol conjugates. Analysis of either reductions in lignin in knockdown lines, or the addition of novel monolignol conjugates, directly identifies the xylary parenchyma and fiber cell populations that contribute to the stem lignification and the developmental timing at which each contribution is most important.;,citation_author=Rebecca A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Identification and characterization of a set of monocot BAHD monolignol transferases;,citation_abstract=Plant BAHD acyltransferases perform a wide range of enzymatic tasks in primary and secondary metabolism. Acyl-CoA monolignol transferases, which couple a CoA substrate to a monolignol creating an ester linkage, represent a more recent class of such acyltransferases. The resulting conjugates may be used for plant defense but are also deployed as important “monomers” for lignification, in which they are incorporated into the growing lignin polymer chain. p-Coumaroyl-CoA monolignol transferases (PMTs) increase the production of monolignol p-coumarates, and feruloyl-CoA monolignol transferases (FMTs) catalyze the production of monolignol ferulate conjugates. We identified putative FMT and PMT enzymes in sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) and have compared their activities to those of known monolignol transferases. The putative FMT enzymes produced both monolignol ferulate and monolignol p-coumarate conjugates, whereas the putative PMT enzymes produced monolignol p-coumarate conjugates. Enzyme activity measurements revealed that the putative FMT enzymes are not as efficient as the rice (Oryza sativa) control OsFMT enzyme under the conditions tested, but the SbPMT enzyme is as active as the control OsPMT enzyme. These putative FMTs and PMTs were transformed into Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) to test their activities and abilities to biosynthesize monolignol conjugates for lignification in planta. The presence of ferulates and p-coumarates on the lignin of these transformants indicated that the putative FMTs and PMTs act as functional feruloyl-CoA and p-coumaroyl-CoA monolignol transferases within plants.;,citation_author=Rebecca A Smith;,citation_author=Emily T Beebe;,citation_author=Craig A Bingman;,citation_author=Kirk Vander Meulen;,citation_author=Alexis Eugene;,citation_author=Alexander J Steiner;,citation_author=Steven D Karlen;,citation_author=John Ralph;,citation_author=Brian G Fox;,citation_publication_date=2022-02;,citation_cover_date=2022-02;,citation_year=2022;,citation_doi=10.1093/plphys/kiac035;,citation_issn=0032-0889;,citation_journal_title=Plant Physiol.;">

Although it is of significant interest, the origin of the functional discrimination between tyrosinases and catechol oxidases has been unclear. Recently, it has been postulated that a glutamate and an asparagine bind and activate a conserved water molecule towards deprotonation of monophenols. Here we demonstrate for the first time that a polyphenoloxidase, which exhibits only diphenolase activity, can be transformed to a tyrosinase by mutation to introduce an asparagine. The asparagine and a conserved glutamate are necessary to properly orient the conserved water in order to abstract a proton from the monophenol.

We performed a genome-wide analysis of this superfamily in Eucalyptus, one of the most planted hardwood trees world-wide. A total of 141 predicted R2R3-MYB sequences identified in the Eucalyptus grandis genome sequence were subjected to comparative phylogenetic analyses with Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa, Populus trichocarpa and Vitis vinifera.

We found some R2R3-MYB subgroups with expanded membership in E. grandis, V. vinifera and P. trichocarpa, and others preferentially found in woody species, suggesting diversification of specific functions in woody plants. By contrast, subgroups containing key genes regulating lignin biosynthesis and secondary cell wall formation are more conserved across all of the species analysed. In Eucalyptus, R2R3-MYB tandem gene duplications seem to disproportionately affect woody-preferential and woody-expanded subgroups.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Woody-Preferential Gene EgMYB88 Regulates the Biosynthesis of Phenylpropanoid-Derived Compounds in Wood;,citation_abstract=Comparative phylogenetic analyses of the R2R3-MYB transcription factor family revealed that five subgroups were preferentially found in woody species and were totally absent from Brassicaceae and monocots (Soler et al., 2015). Here, we analyzed one of these subgroups (WPS-I) for which no gene had been yet characterized. Most Eucalyptus members of WPS-I are preferentially expressed in the vascular cambium, the secondary meristem responsible for tree radial growth. We focused on EgMYB88, which is the most specifically and highly expressed in vascular tissues, and showed that it behaves as a transcriptional activator in yeast. Then, we functionally characterized EgMYB88 in both transgenic Arabidopsis and poplar plants overexpressing either the native or the dominant repression form (fused to the Ethylene-responsive element binding factor-associated Amphiphilic Repression motif, EAR). The transgenic Arabidopsis lines had no phenotype whereas the poplar lines overexpressing EgMYB88 exhibited a substantial increase in the levels of the flavonoid catechin and of some salicinoid phenolic glycosides (salicortin, salireposide and tremulacin), in agreement with the increase of the transcript levels of landmark biosynthetic genes. A change in the lignin structure (increase in the syringyl versus guaiacyl, S/G ratio) was also observed. Poplar lines overexpressing the EgMYB88 dominant repression form did not show a strict opposite phenotype. The level of catechin was reduced, but the levels of the salicinoid phenolic glycosides and the S/G ratio remained unchanged. In addition, they showed a reduction in soluble oligolignols containing sinapyl p-hydroxybenzoate accompanied by a mild reduction of the insoluble lignin content. Altogether, these results suggest that EgMYB88, and more largely members of the WPS-I group, could control in cambium and in the first layers of differentiating xylem the biosynthesis of some phenylpropanoid-derived secondary metabolites including lignin.;,citation_author=Marçal Soler;,citation_author=Anna Plasencia;,citation_author=Jorge Lepikson-Neto;,citation_author=Eduardo L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Constitutive Expression of miR408 Improves Biomass and Seed Yield in Arabidopsis;,citation_abstract=miR408 is highly conserved among different plant species and targets transcripts encoding copper-binding proteins. The function of miR408 in reproductive development remains largely unclear despite it being known to play important roles during vegetative development in Arabidopsis. Here, we show that transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing MIR408 have altered morphology including significantly increased leaf area, petiole length, plant height, flower size, and silique length, resulting in enhanced biomass and seed yield. The increase in plant size was primarily due to cell expansion rather than cell proliferation, and was consistent with higher levels of myosin gene expression and gibberellic acid (GA) measured in transgenic plants. In addition, photosynthetic rate was significantly increased in the MIR408-overexpressing plants, as manifested by higher levels of chloroplastic copper content and plastocyanin (PC) expression. In contrast, overexpression of miR408-regulated targets, Plantacyanin and Laccase 13, resulted in reduced biomass production and seed yield. RNA-sequencing revealed that genes involved in primary metabolism and stress response were preferentially enriched in the genes upregulated in MIR408-overexpressing plants. These results indicate that miR408 plays an important role in regulating biomass and seed yield and that MIR408 may be a potential candidate gene involved in the domestication of agricultural crops.;,citation_author=Zhaoqing Song;,citation_author=Lifen Zhang;,citation_author=Yulong Wang;,citation_author=Haixia Li;,citation_author=Shuang Li;,citation_author=Huijie Zhao;,citation_author=Huiyong Zhang;,citation_publication_date=2018;,citation_cover_date=2018;,citation_year=2018;,citation_issue=January;,citation_doi=10.3389/fpls.2017.02114;,citation_issn=1664-462X;,citation_volume=8;,citation_journal_title=Front.

Here we propose a new method to quantify lignin monomer composition in detail by pyrolysis-gas chromatography (Py-GC) using acetylated lignin samples. The lignin acetylation procedure would contribute to prevent secondary formation of cinnamaldehydes from the corresponding alcohol forms during pyrolysis, which are otherwise unavoidable in conventional Py-GC process to some extent. On the basis of the characteristic peaks on the pyrograms of the acetylated sample, lignin monomer compositions in various dehydrogenative polymers (DHP) as lignin model compounds were determined, taking even minor components such as cinnamaldehydes into consideration. The observed compositions by Py-GC were in good agreement with the supplied lignin monomer contents on DHP synthesis.

These main fractions were further subjected to ball milling at -15 ~ and extraction (dioxane-water) after which the polysaccharides were hydrolyzed by enzymic treatment and lignin was extracted. Finally, the material representing the main fractions M and S was divided into two subfractions (soluble (s) and insoluble (i)) using 1;2dichloroethane-ethanol (2: 1) as solvent. The lignin in the subfractions (primarily the s fractions) was characterized by spectroscopic methods (1H NMR, 1~C NMR, IR, and UV). Further information was obtained by methoxyl analyses and chromatography of the flagmerits obtained after methylation and permanganate and hitrobenzene oxidations of the main fractions. The molecular weight distribution of the isolated lignin was also determined (by GPC). Finally, the main fractions were hydrolyzed and the resulting monosacchafides were determined as alditol acetates by GLC. Because of uncertainties associated with the experimental techniques no strictly quantitative conclusions could be drawn from the results obtained and there were only few indications of structural differences in the liL’nins according to their morphological location. The rather small differences obtained allow the following tentative conclusions: Compared with secondary wall liwnin, middle lamella lignin contained somewhat more open a-O-4 linkages as well as structures with fl-fl linkages but less structures containing t-O-4 linkages. No conclusive evidence was found for the differences in the content of either/3-1 linkages or phenolic and allphatic hydroxyl groups. However, somewhat fewer methoxyl groups and phenylcoumaran structures and more carbonyl groups (at least at aposition associated with free phenolic structures) were present in the middle lamella than in the secondary wall lignin and the data also indicated a slightly higher degree of condensation of the former lignin. Considerable differences were found in the carbohydrate composition: the middle lamella fraction contained more rhamnose, arabinose, and xylose moieties than the secondary wall fraction whereas the opposite was true for the content of mannose and glUCOSe.;,citation_author=J.

We measured radial and axial diffusion of oxygen against nitrogen gas in wood of coniferous (Picea abies (L.) Karst. and Taxus baccata L.), ring-porous (Quercus robur L. and Fraxinus excelsior L.) and diffuse-porous (Fagus sylvatica L. and Carpinus betulus L.) trees at different water and gas contents in the laboratory. The diffusion coefficient (D) in radial direction was mostly between 10-11 and 10-7&nbsp;m2&nbsp;s-1 and was strongly related to the gas content. At 40% gas volume, D increased 5–13-fold in Picea, Taxus and Quercus, 36-fold in Fraxinus, and about 1000-fold in Carpinus and Fagus relative to D at 15% gas volume. In the axial direction, diffusion was 1 or 2 orders of magnitude faster. Between-species differences in diffusion velocities can largely be explained by wood structure. In general, D was lowest in conifers, highest in diffuse-porous and intermediate in ring-porous hardwoods, where the large vessels were mostly blocked by tyloses. Model calculations showed that at very high water content, radial diffusion can be too low to ensure the supply of respiring sapwood with sufficient oxygen and an important function of gas in living stems appears to be the supply of oxygen through storage and diffusion.;,citation_author=Johannes Sorz;,citation_author=Peter Hietz;,citation_publication_date=2006-01;,citation_cover_date=2006-01;,citation_year=2006;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1007/s00468-005-0010-x;,citation_issn=1432-2285;,citation_volume=20;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Trees;">

Cellulose is the primary load-bearing polysaccharide of plant cell walls and enables cell walls to maintain cellular shape and rigidity. The CSC is comprised of functionally distinct cellulose synthase A (CESA) proteins, which are responsible for synthesizing cellulose, and additional accessory proteins. Moreover, CESA-like (CSL) proteins are proposed to synthesize other essential non-cellulosic polysaccharides that comprise plant cell walls. The deposition of cell-wall polysaccharides is dynamically regulated in response to a variety of developmental and environmental stimuli, and post-translational phosphorylation has been proposed as one mechanism to mediate this dynamic regulation. In this review, we discuss CSC composition, the dynamics of CSCs in vivo, critical studies that highlight the post-translational control of CESAs and CSLs, and the receptor kinases implicated in plant cell-wall biosynthesis.

Since then the quantum yield decreases with increasing light intensity this effect is called photoquenching. Kinetic analysis of the excitation in a general level scheme of a large molecule yields expressions for the quentum yield of a laser-induced photochemical process. Calculation of the quantum yield for various combinations of molecular parameters and laser pulse characteristics shows quenching of the photochemical process due to excited state absorption, at laser intensities for which bleaching effects and other nonlinear processes are negligeable. The applicability of the steady state approximation in analyzing laser-induced processes is discussed. Experiments are reported, which confirm the calculated intensity-dependent quantum yield function. Previous measurements of intensity-induced quenching can now be discussed quantitatively. Care should be taken in interpreting laser-induced photochemical yields, especially at mode locked laser intensities; correct values can only be obtained by extrapolation to zero laser intensity. © 1973.;,citation_author=Shammai Speiser;,citation_author=Renie Van der Werf;,citation_author=Jan Kommandeur;,citation_publication_date=1973;,citation_cover_date=1973;,citation_year=1973;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1016/0301-0104(73)80042-4;,citation_issn=03010104;,citation_volume=1;,citation_journal_title=Chem.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Evolution of water transport and xylem structure;,citation_abstract=Land plants need water to replace the evaporation that occurs while atmospheric CO2 is diffusing into photosynthetic tissue. The water-for-carbon exchange rate is poor, and evolutionary history indicates a progression of innovations for cheap water transport—beginning in order with capillary suction at cell walls, stomatal regulation, hydroids, tracheids, secondary xylem, endodermis, and vessels. The radiation of plants in the Silurian and Devonian occurred when the need for water was at an all-time low because of high CO2 concentration. Transport improvements appeared as water demand increased and CO2 dropped to current values in the Carboniferous and Permian. Stomatal regulation and high-conductivity conduits permitted larger plants and a transition from poikilohydric to homoiohydric water relations. The evolution of conduits from hydroids through tracheids to vessels reflects the need to balance resistance to implosion and cavitation versus maximum hydraulic conductance and minimum conduit investment. Localization of rigidifying lignin away from the lumen surface and porous wall regions during tracheid evolution, and the origin of pits, acted to maintain wall strength and permeability while minimizing cavitation. Vessels mark the pinnacle of efficiency, making vines and dense, stiff woods possible without sacrificing conductivity or cavitation resistance. However, vessels make cavitation-resistant wood more expensive and may compromise refilling efficiency versus tracheids. Vascular networks maximize hydraulic conductivity and protection from cavitation at minimum investment by following Murray’s law and localizing resistances to the periphery. A future challenge is to quantify the significance of xylem structure in terms of the carbon cost of transpiration and the net carbon profit via gas exchange.;,citation_author=John S.

We developed a system for repeated in situ measurement of O2 at different depths within stems of Acer rubrum, Fraxinus americana, Tsuga canadensis, and Quercus rubra. In summer during active transpiration, O2 declined from the cambium toward the heartwood boundary in F. americana, T. canadensis and Q. rubra, but remained constant in A. rubrum. Average sapwood O2 was about 10%, with the lowest values observed in the innermost sapwood around 3–5%. Before spring leaf flush, O2 content in the outer sapwood was reduced in Q. rubra and T. canadensis relative to summer, and was occasionally lower than in the inner sapwood. Sapwood respiration in T. canadensis was constant above 5% O2, but reduced by about 65% at 1% O2. In F. americana, sapwood respiration was constant above 10% O2 but reduced by 25% at 5% O2, and by 75% at 1% O2, the most extreme inhibition observed. However, when prolonged (72 h) exposure to 1%, 5% and 10% O2 was followed by re-equilibration to 10% O2, no inhibition was found. Given the minor (and reversible) effect of low O2 on parenchyma metabolism at levels common in the inner sapwood, it is unlikely that O2 content severely limits parenchyma respiration or leads to parenchyma cell death during sapwood senescence. Within-stem O2 levels may instead be most relevant to metabolism in the cambial zone and phloem, for which sapwood could serve as a significant source of O2.;,citation_author=R.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Allelochemical MDCA Inhibits Lignification and Affects Auxin Homeostasis;,citation_abstract=The phenylpropanoid 3,4-(methylenedioxy)cinnamic acid (MDCA) is a plant-derived compound first extracted from roots of Asparagus &nbsp;officinalis and further characterized as an allelochemical. Later on, MDCA was identified as an efficient inhibitor of 4-COUMARATE-CoA LIGASE (4CL), a key enzyme of the general phenylpropanoid pathway. By blocking 4CL, MDCA affects the biosynthesis of many important metabolites, which might explain its phytotoxicity. To decipher the molecular basis of the allelochemical activity of MDCA, we evaluated the effect of this compound on Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings. Metabolic profiling revealed that MDCA is converted in planta into piperonylic acid (PA), an inhibitor of CINNAMATE-4-HYDROXYLASE (C4H), the enzyme directly upstream of 4CL. The inhibition of C4H was also reflected in the phenolic profile of MDCA-treated plants. Treatment of in vitro grown plants resulted in an inhibition of primary root growth and a proliferation of lateral and adventitious roots. These observed growth defects were not the consequence of lignin perturbation, but rather the result of disturbing auxin homeostasis. Based on DII-VENUS quantification and direct measurement of cellular auxin transport, we concluded that MDCA disturbs auxin gradients by interfering with auxin efflux. In addition, mass spectrometry was used to show that MDCA triggers auxin biosynthesis, conjugation, and catabolism. A similar shift in auxin homeostasis was found in the c4h mutant ref3-2, indicating that MDCA triggers a cross talk between the phenylpropanoid and auxin biosynthetic pathways independent from the observed auxin efflux inhibition.

However, while these types of osmotic stress can create phenotypes that resemble those of drought, it remains unclear how they compare at the molecular level. Here, using transcriptomics, we demonstrate that these assays are unable to replicate drought signaling responses in the Arabidopsis root. Indeed, we found a significant number of genes that were induced by drought were in fact repressed by such treatments. Since our results question the utility of PEG, mannitol and salt, we designed a new method for simulating drought. By simply adding less water to agar, our “low-water agar” assay elicits gene expression responses that compare more favorably to drought stress. Furthermore, we show our approach can be leveraged as a high-throughput assay to investigate natural variation in drought responses.;,citation_author=Gonzalez Stephen;,citation_author=Swift Joseph;,citation_author=Xu Jiaying;,citation_author=Illouz-Eliaz Natanella;,citation_author=Nery Joseph R;,citation_author=Ecker Joseph R;,citation_publication_date=2023-02;,citation_cover_date=2023-02;,citation_year=2023;,citation_doi=10.7554/eLife.84747;,citation_volume=12;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=eLife;,citation_publisher=eLife Sciences Publications Limited;">

With the use of cell suspension cultures of sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus), an in-depth study of laccase, one of the oxidative enzymes possibly responsible for catalyzing the dehydrogenative polymerization of monolignols in the extracellular matrix, was undertaken. The time course for secretion of laccase into suspension culture medium was determined with respect to age and mass of the cells. Laccase was completely separated from peroxidase activity by hydrophobic interaction column chromatography, and its purity was assessed with different types of gel electrophoresis (isoelectric focusing-, native-, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis). Amino acid and glycosyl analyses of the purified enzyme were compared with those reported from previous studies of plant and fungal laccases. The specific activity of laccase toward several common substrates, including monolignols, was determined. Unlike a laccase purified from the Japanese lacquer tree (Rhus vernicifera), laccase from sycamore maple oxidized sinapyl, coniferyl, and p-coumaryl alcohols to form water-insoluble polymers (dehydrogenation polymers).;,citation_author=R Sterjiades;,citation_author=J F Dean;,citation_author=Karl-Erik L Eriksson;,citation_publication_date=1992;,citation_cover_date=1992;,citation_year=1992;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1104/pp.99.3.1162;,citation_isbn=1532-2548 (Electronic) 0032-0889 (Linking);,citation_issn=0032-0889;,citation_pmid=16668984;,citation_volume=99;,citation_journal_title=Plant Physiol.;">

Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) microspectroscopy indicated that down-regulation of CAD had resulted in the incorporation of moieties with conjugated carbonyl groups into lignin and that the overall extent of cross-linking, particularly of guaiacyl (4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl) rings, in the lignin had altered. The FT-Raman spectra of manipulated xylem exhibited maxima consistent with the presence of elevated levels of aldehydic groups conjugated to a carbon-carbon double bond and a guaiacyl ring. These maxima were particularly intense in the spectra of xylem from clone 37, the xylem of which exhibits a uniform red coloration, and their absolute frequencies matched those of coniferaldehyde. Furthermore, xylem from clone 37 was found to have a higher content of carbonyl groups than that of clone 49 or the wild-type (clone 37: clone 49: wild-type; 2.4:1.6:1.0) as measured by a degradative chemical method. This is the first report of the combined use of FT-IR and FT-Raman spectroscopies to study lignin structure in situ. These analyses provide strong evidence for the incorporation of cinnamaldehyde groups into the lignin of transgenic plants with down-regulated CAD expression. In addition, these non-destructive analyses also suggest that the plants transformed with antisense CAD, in particular clone 37, may contain lignin that is less condensed (cross-linked) than that of the wild-type.;,citation_author=Derek Stewart;,citation_author=Nabila Yahiaoui;,citation_author=Gordon J.

In fruit affected by the chill-induced internal browning disorder known as Blackheart, PPO activity was 10-fold higher than in unaffected fruit, and there was a direct correlation between PPO activity and the severity of Blackheart symptoms. Degenerate oligonucleotide primers were designed to conserved regions of plant PPO genes, and used to amplify two distinct pineapple PPO cDNAs, designated PINPPO1 (2181 bp) and PINPPO2 (1319 bp), which share 81% sequence identity at the DNA level and show a high degree of homology to other plant PPO genes. PINPPO1 encodes a peptide of 604 amino acids, including a putative transit peptide of 95 amino acids and two copper-binding regions, CuA and CuB, which are highly conserved in plant PPOs. Southern analysis suggested the presence of at least four PPO genes in pineapple. Expression of PINPPO1 and PINPPO2 was low in roots, leaves, inflorescence tissues and developing fruit, but was strongly up-regulated in response to chilling and wounding.

Compositional data derived from both standard degradative methods and NMR analyses of the entire lignin component (as well as isolated lignin fraction) indicated that the C4HF5H transgenic’s lignin was comprised of as much as 97.5% syringyl units (derived from sinapyl alcohol), the remainder being guaiacyl units (derived from coniferyl alcohol); the syringyl level in the wild-type control was 68%. The resultant transgenic lignins are more linear and display a lower degree of polymerization. Although the crucial beta-ether content is similar, the distribution of other interunit linkages in the lignin polymer is markedly different, with higher resinol (beta-beta) and spirodienone (beta-1) contents, but with virtually no phenylcoumarans (beta-5, which can only be formed from guaiacyl units). p-Hydroxybenzoates, acylating the gamma-positions of lignin side chains, were reduced by &amp;amp;amp;gt;50%, suggesting consequent impacts on related pathways. A model depicting the putative structure of the transgenic lignin resulting from the overexpression of F5H is presented.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Robust Summarization and Inference in Proteome-wide Label-free Quantification;,citation_abstract=Label-Free Quantitative mass spectrometry based workflows for differential expression (DE) analysis of proteins impose important challenges on the data analysis because of peptide-specific effects and context dependent missingness of peptide intensities. Peptide-based workflows, like MSqRob, test for DE directly from peptide intensities and outperform summarization methods which first aggregate MS1 peptide intensities to protein intensities before DE analysis. However, these methods are computationally expensive, often hard to understand for the non-specialized end-user, and do not provide protein summaries, which are important for visualization or downstream processing. In this work, we therefore evaluate state-of-the-art summarization strategies using a benchmark spike-in dataset and discuss why and when these fail compared with the state-of-the-art peptide based model, MSqRob. Based on this evaluation, we propose a novel summarization strategy, MSqRobSum, which estimates MSqRob’s model parameters in a two-stage procedure circumventing the drawbacks of peptide-based workflows. MSqRobSum maintains MSqRob’s superior performance, while providing useful protein expression summaries for plotting and downstream analysis. Summarizing peptide to protein intensities considerably reduces the computational complexity, the memory footprint and the model complexity, and makes it easier to disseminate DE inferred on protein summaries. Moreover, MSqRobSum provides a highly modular analysis framework, which provides researchers with full flexibility to develop data analysis workflows tailored toward their specific applications.;,citation_author=Adriaan Sticker;,citation_author=Ludger Goeminne;,citation_author=Lennart Martens;,citation_author=Lieven Clement;,citation_publication_date=2020-07;,citation_cover_date=2020-07;,citation_year=2020;,citation_issue=7;,citation_doi=10.1074/mcp.RA119.001624;,citation_issn=1535-9476;,citation_volume=19;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Mol.

Efficient breeding for chilling tolerance is hampered by both the complex physiological response of maize to chilling temperatures and the difficulty to accurately measure chilling tolerance in the field under fluctuating climatic conditions. For this research, we used genome-wide association (GWA) mapping to identify genes underlying chilling tolerance under both controlled and field conditions in a broad germplasm collection of 375 maize inbred lines genotyped with 56 110 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). We identified 19 highly significant association signals explaining between 5.7 and 52.5% of the phenotypic variance observed for early growth and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters. The allelic effect of several SNPs identified for early growth was associated with temperature and incident radiation. Candidate genes involved in ethylene signalling, brassinolide, and lignin biosynthesis were found in their vicinity. The frequent involvement of candidate genes into signalling or gene expression regulation underlines the complex response of photosynthetic performance and early growth to climatic conditions, and supports pleiotropism as a major cause of co-locations of quantitative trait loci for these highly polygenic traits.;,citation_author=Alexander Strigens;,citation_author=Niclas M.

The presence of actin in tobacco pollen tube detergent-insoluble membranes and the preferential distribution of these domains on the apical plasma membrane encouraged us to formulate the intriguing hypothesis that sterols and sphingolipids could be a “trait d’union” between actin dynamics and polarized secretion at the tip. To unravel the role of sterols and sphingolipids in tobacco pollen tube growth, we used squalestatin and myriocin, inhibitors of sterol and sphingolipid biosynthesis, respectively, to determine whether lipid modifications affect actin fringe morphology and dynamics, leading to changes in clear zone organization and cell wall deposition, thus suggesting a role played by these lipids in successful fertilization.;,citation_author=Nadia Stroppa;,citation_author=Elisabetta Onelli;,citation_author=Patrick Moreau;,citation_author=Lilly Maneta-Peyret;,citation_author=Valeria Berno;,citation_author=Eugenia Cammarota;,citation_author=Roberto Ambrosini;,citation_author=Marco Caccianiga;,citation_author=Monica Scali;,citation_author=Alessandra Moscatelli;,citation_publication_date=2023-01;,citation_cover_date=2023-01;,citation_year=2023;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.3390/plants12010008;,citation_issn=2223-7747;,citation_volume=12;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Plants;,citation_publisher=Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute;">

Here, we developed a toolkit, based on a highly intron-optimized zCas9i gene, which allows assembly of nuclease constructs expressing up to 32 single guide RNAs (sgRNAs). We used this toolkit to explore the limits of multiplexing in two major model species, and report on the isolation of transgene-free octuple (8) Nicotiana benthamiana and duodecuple (12) Arabidopsis thaliana mutant lines in a single generation (T1 and T2, respectively). We developed novel counter-selection markers for N. benthamiana, most importantly Sl-FAST2, comparable to the well-established Arabidopsis seed fluorescence marker, and FCY-UPP, based on the production of toxic 5-fluorouracil in the presence of a precursor. Targeting eight genes with an array of nine different sgRNAs and relying on FCY-UPP for selection of non-transgenic T1, we identified N. benthamiana mutant lines with astonishingly high efficiencies: All analyzed plants carried mutations in all genes (approximately 112/116 target sites edited). Furthermore, we targeted 12 genes by an array of 24 sgRNAs in A. thaliana. Efficiency was significantly lower in A. thaliana, and our results indicate Cas9 availability is the limiting factor in such higher-order multiplexing applications.

Several studies have reported the identification of catechol-amino acid adducts from sclerotizing cuticle involving histidine, lysine, and tyrosine, though there have been no reports of a catechol linked between two amino acid residues. Previously, we reported an in vitro model system for sclerotization and observed that stable protein oligomers were formed, presumably through cross-links with oxidized catecholamines [Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. (2006) 36, 353–365]. Using site-directed mutagenesis we created a mutant lacking histidine, rMsCP36(H65A/H178A), to investigate the possible involvement of the two histidine residues of MsCP36 in cross-linking. Surprisingly, this alteration had little or no effect on the formation of protein oligomers as determined by SDS-PAGE analysis. Blocking of the free amino groups in lysyl side chains and the amino-terminus by succinylation diminished, but did not eliminate, cross-linking of either rMsCP36 or rMsCP36(H65A/H178A). We also examined the possibility that cross-linking was due to intermolecular dityrosine linkages. Immunoblot analysis utilizing a monoclonal antibody known to recognize peptidyl dityrosine indicated that dityrosyl cross-links were present. Taken together, these results indicate that lysyl residues are important for the cross-linking of the cuticle protein rMsCP36, but that additional residues other than histidine can also contribute.;,citation_author=Richard J.

The bark of the pine contained two nematicides, methyl ferulate and (+)-pinoresinol. PSM, which showed the highest nematicidal activity (LD50 was 4 ppm), was also contained in the heartwood of P. strobus and the heartwood and bark of P. palustris. The resistance of these pines to the pine wood nematode is considered to be attributed to the presence of these endogenously defending substances.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Reactivities of quinone methides versus o-Quinones in catecholamine metabolism and eumelanin biosynthesis;,citation_abstract=Melanin is an important biopolymeric pigment produced in a vast majority of organisms. Tyrosine and its hydroxylated product, dopa, form the starting material for melanin biosynthesis. Earlier studies by Raper and Mason resulted in the identification of dopachrome and dihydroxyindoles as important intermediates and paved way for the establishment of well-known Raper-Mason pathway for the biogenesis of brown to black eumelanins. Tyrosinase catalyzes the oxidation of tyrosine as well as dopa to dopaquinone. Dopaquinone thus formed, undergoes intramolecular cyclization to form leucochrome, which is further oxidized to dopachrome. Dopachrome is either converted into 5,6-dihydroxyindole by decarboxylative aromatization or isomerized into 5,6-dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid. Oxidative polymerization of these two dihydroxyindoles eventually produces eumelanin pigments via melanochrome. While the role of quinones in the biosynthetic pathway is very well acknowledged, that of isomeric quinone methides, however, remained marginalized. This review article summarizes the key role of quinone methides during the oxidative transformation of a vast array of catecholamine derivatives and brings out the importance of these transient reactive species during the melanogenic process.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Cloning and Characterization of Red Clover Polyphenol Oxidase cDNAs and Expression of Active Protein in Escherichia coli and Transgenic Alfalfa;,citation_abstract=Red clover (Trifolium pratense) leaves contain high levels of polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity and o-diphenol substrates. Wounding of leaves during harvest and ensiling results in browning of leaf tissues from activity of PPO on the o-diphenols. In association with browning, leaf proteins remain undegraded during ensiling, presumably due to PPO-generated o-quinone inhibition of leaf proteases. We cloned three red clover PPO cDNAs, PPO1, PPO2, and PPO3, from a leaf cDNA library. Sequence comparisons among the three red clover PPO clones indicated they are 87% to 90% identical at the nucleotide level (80%-83% amino acid identity). All three encode proteins predicted to localize to the chloroplast thylakoid lumen. RNA-blotting and immunoblotting experiments indicated PPO1 is expressed primarily in young leaves, PPO2 in flowers and petioles, and PPO3 in leaves and possibly flowers. We expressed mature PPO1 in Escherichia coli. A portion of the expressed protein was soluble and functional in an assay for PPO activity. We also expressed the red clover PPO cDNAs under the control of a constitutive promoter in alfalfa (Medicago sativa). The expressed red clover PPO proteins were active in alfalfa extracts as evidenced by o-diphenol-dependant extract browning and quantitative assays of PPO activity. Proteolysis in leaf extracts of alfalfa expressing red clover PPO1 was dramatically reduced in the presence of an o-diphenol compared to controls. Transgenic alfalfa expressing red clover PPO should prove an excellent model system to further characterize the red clover PPO enzymes and PPO-mediated inhibition of postharvest proteolysis in forage plants.;,citation_author=M.

A rapid screening method is highly desirable to assess lignin composition in a large number of samples. We have developed a nondestructive and label-free Fourier transform Raman (FT-Raman) spectroscopic method that is capable of rapidly and reliably measuring the S/G ratio with minimal sample preparation. A variety of feedstocks, including hardwood (Eucalyptus globulus), softwood (Pinus radiata), herbaceous plants (Zea mays, Panicum virgatum, and Sorghum bicolor), and a model dicot (Arabidopsis thaliana) were measured using this technique and the corresponding S/G ratio was calculated after spectral deconvolution based on the S and G bands identified using a known library of model compounds. The results obtained using this technique were successfully validated by pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (pyro-GC/MS). This technique holds significant promise in the rapid screening of engineered feedstocks as part of a comprehensive screening methodology that is correlated with biomass recalcitrance. Biotechnol.

However, the underlying mechanisms of this pathway remain elusive. Here, we found that miR319 overexpression results in a decrease in TCP4 abundance and secondary cell wall formation in the stem. Conversely, constitutive expression of miR319-resistant TCP4 (rTCP4) promotes secondary cell wall formation, indicating that miR319-mediated TCP4 controls secondary cell wall formation during development. Further analysis revealed that TCP4 might directly bind the promoter of VND7 to activate its expression, which triggers the expression of a VND7 transcriptional network associated with secondary cell wall biosynthesis and programmed cell death and accelerates vessel formation. In addition, the development process gradually increased TCP4 expression. These results suggest that miR319 and its target TCP4 can act as switches that turn on secondary cell wall synthesis and programmed cell death. This article is protected by copyright.

We report here that the expression of ZmmiR528, a monocot-specific microRNA, is induced by N&nbsp;luxury but reduced by N deficiency. We show by the thioacidolysis and acetyl bromide analysis that N luxury significantly reduces the generation of H, G, and S monomers of the lignin as well as its total content in maize shoots.

In situ hybridization showed that ZmmiR528 is mainly expressed in maize vascular tissues. Knockdown of ZmmiR528 or overexpression of ZmLAC3 significantly increased the lignin content and rind penetrometer resistance of maize stems. In contrast, transgenic maize plants overexpressing ZmmiR528 had reduced lignin content and rind penetrometer resistance and were prone to lodging under N-luxury conditions.&nbsp;RNA-sequencing analysis revealed that ZmPAL7 and ZmPAL8 are upregulated in transgenic maize lines downregulating ZmmiR528.

Whereas ATR1 is constitutively expressed, the expression of ATR2 appears to be induced during lignin biosynthesis and upon stresses. Therefore, ATR2 was hypothesized to be preferentially involved in providing electrons to the three CYP450s involved in lignin biosynthesis: CINNAMATE 4-HYDROXYLASE (C4H), p-COUMARATE 3-HYDROXYLASE1 (C3H1), and FERULATE 5-HYDROXYLASE1 (F5H1). Here, we show that the atr2 mutation resulted in a 6% reduction in total lignin amount in the main inflorescence stem and a compositional shift of the remaining lignin to a 10-fold higher fraction of p-hydroxyphenyl units at the expense of syringyl units. Phenolic profiling revealed shifts in lignin-related phenolic metabolites, in particular with the substrates of C4H, C3H1 and F5H1 accumulating in atr2 mutants. Glucosinolate and flavonol glycoside biosynthesis, both of which also rely on CYP450 activities, appeared less affected.

Over a period of 3 yr, we studied the effects of warming and altered precipitation on mass loss and compound-specific decomposition using two litter types that possessed similar heteropolymer chemistry, but different proportions of labile and recalcitrant compounds.

After 3 yr, although both litter types had lost similar amounts of mass, warming (c. 4^\circC) and supplemental precipitation (150% of ambient) together accelerated the degradation of alkyl-carbon and lignin only in the more recalcitrant litter, highlighting the role of initial litter quality in determining whether the chemistry of litter residues converges or diverges under different climates.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Quantitative fluorescence microscopy and image deconvolution;,citation_abstract=Quantitative imaging and image deconvolution have become standard techniques for the modern cell biologist because they can form the basis of an increasing number of assays for molecular function in a cellular context. There are two major types of deconvolution approaches-deblurring and restoration algorithms. Deblurring algorithms remove blur but treat a series of optical sections as individual two-dimensional entities and therefore sometimes mishandle blurred light. Restoration algorithms determine an object that, when convolved with the point-spread function of the microscope, could produce the image data. The advantages and disadvantages of these methods are discussed in this chapter. Image deconvolution in fluorescence microscopy has usually been applied to high-resolution imaging to improve contrast and thus detect small, dim objects that might otherwise be obscured. Their proper use demands some consideration of the imaging hardware, the acquisition process, fundamental aspects of photon detection, and image processing. This can prove daunting for some cell biologists, but the power of these techniques has been proven many times in the works cited in the chapter and elsewhere. Their usage is now well defined, so they can be incorporated into the capabilities of most laboratories. A major application of fluorescence microscopy is the quantitative measurement of the localization, dynamics, and interactions of cellular factors. The introduction of green fluorescent protein and its spectral variants has led to a significant increase in the use of fluorescence microscopy as a quantitative assay system. For quantitative imaging assays, it is critical to consider the nature of the image-acquisition system and to validate its response to known standards. Any image-processing algorithms used before quantitative analysis should preserve the relative signal levels in different parts of the image. A very common image-processing algorithm, image deconvolution, is used to remove blurred signal from an image. There are two major types of deconvolution approaches, deblurring and restoration algorithms.

Analysis of small (s) RNA data sets from cultivated indica rice lines, a few landraces, and two wild relatives of rice revealed the presence of abundant 22-nucleotide (nt) reads in wild relatives that mapped to miR397 precursors. miR397 was expressed at very high levels in wild relatives and at negligible levels in high-yielding cultivated lines. In its genera-specific form of 22-nt, miR397 targeted mRNAs encoding laccases that decayed and induced robust secondary cascade silencing in wild species that required RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6. In wild species of rice, reduced expression of laccases resulted in low lignification. As expected, overexpression of miR397 induced de-domestication phenotypes. At least 26 uncharacterized QTLs previously implicated in rice yield overlapped with laccases and miR397 genes. These results suggest that miRNAs contribute to rice domestication-associated phenotypes.;,citation_author=Chenna Swetha;,citation_author=Debjani Basu;,citation_author=Kannan Pachamuthu;,citation_author=Varsha Tirumalai;,citation_author=Ashwin Nair;,citation_author=Melvin Prasad;,citation_author=P.

Although much is now known about proline metabolism, some aspects of its biological functions are still unclear. Here, we discuss the compartmentalization of proline biosynthesis, accumulation and degradation in the cytosol, chloroplast and mitochondria. We also describe the role of proline in cellular homeostasis, including redox balance and energy status. Proline can act as a signaling molecule to modulate mitochondrial functions, influence cell proliferation or cell death and trigger specific gene expression, which can be essential for plant recovery from stress. Although the regulation and function of proline accumulation are not yet completely understood, the engineering of proline metabolism could lead to new opportunities to improve plant tolerance of environmental stresses. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Measurement of the total crystalline cellulose in the inflorescence stem indicates that the irx2 mutant contains approximately 30% of the level present in the wild type (WT). Fourier–Transform Infra Red (FTIR) analysis, however, indicates that there is no decrease in cellulose in primary cell walls of the cortical and epidermal cells of the stem. KOR expression is correlated with cellulose synthesis and is highly expressed in cells synthesising a secondary cell wall. Co-precipitation experiments, using either an epitope-tagged form of KOR or IRX3 (AtCesA7), suggest that KOR is not an integral part of the cellulose synthase complex. These data are supported by immunolocalisation of KOR that suggests that KOR does not localise to sites of secondary cell wall deposition in the developing xylem. The defect in irx2 plant is consistent with a role for KOR in the later stages of secondary cell wall formation, suggesting a role in processing of the growing microfibrils or release of the cellulose synthase complex.;,citation_author=Pio M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=An assessment of the relative contributions of redox and steric issues to laccase specificity towards putative substrates;,citation_abstract=Laccases catalyze the one-electron oxidation of a broad range of substrates coupled to the 4 electron reduction of O2 to H2O. Phenols are typical substrates, because their redox potentials (ranging from 0.5 to 1.0 V vs. NHE) are low enough to allow electron abstraction by the T1 Cu(II) that, although a relatively modest oxidant (in the 0.4-0.8 V range), is the electron-acceptor in laccases. The present study comparatively investigated the oxidation performances of Trametes villosa and Myceliophthora thermophila laccases, two enzymes markedly differing in redox potential (0.79 and 0.46 V). The oxidation efficiency and kinetic constants of laccase-catalyzed conversion of putative substrates were determined. Hammett plots related to the oxidation of substituted phenols by the two laccases, in combination with the kinetic isotope effect determination, confirmed a rate-determining electron transfer from the substrate to the enzyme. The efficiency of oxidation was found to increase with the decrease in redox potential of the substrates, and the Marcus reorganisation energy for electron transfer to the T1 copper site was determined. Steric hindrance to substrate docking was inferred because some of the phenols and anilines investigated, despite possessing a redox potential compatible with one-electron abstraction, were scarcely oxidised. A threshold value of steric hindrance of the substrate, allowed for fitting into the active site of T. villosa laccase, was extrapolated from structural information provided by X-ray analysis of T. versicolor lac3B, sharing an identity of 99% at the protein level, thus enabling us to assess the relative contribution of steric and redox properties of a substrate in determining its susceptibility to laccase oxidation. The inferred structural threshold is compatible with the distance between two phenylalanine residues that mark the entrance to the active site.

There are controversies regarding the glucan chain number (N) of CMFs during initial synthesis and whether they become fused afterward. Here, we combined small-angle X-ray scattering, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance and X-ray diffraction analyses to resolve CMF nanostructures in native wood. We developed small-angle X-ray scattering measurement methods for the cross-section aspect ratio and area of the crystalline-ordered CMF core, which has a higher scattering length density than the semidisordered shell zone. The 1:1 aspect ratio suggested that CMFs remain mostly segregated, not fused. The area measurement reflected the chain number in the core zone (Ncore). To measure the ratio of ordered cellulose over total cellulose (Roc) by solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance, we developed a method termed global iterative fitting of T1\rho-edited decay (GIFTED), in addition to the conventional proton spin relaxation editing method. Using the formula N = Ncore/Roc, most wood CMFs were found to contain 24 glucan chains, conserved between gymnosperm and angiosperm trees. The average CMF has a crystalline-ordered core of ~2.2 nm diameter and a semidisordered shell of ~0.5 nm thickness. In naturally and artificially aged wood, we observed only CMF aggregation (contact without crystalline continuity) but not fusion (forming a conjoined crystalline unit). This further argued against the existence of partially fused CMFs in new wood, overturning the recently proposed 18-chain fusion hypothesis. Our findings are important for advancing wood structural knowledge and more efficient use of wood resources in sustainable bio-economies.;,citation_author=Hwan-Ching Tai;,citation_author=Chih-Hui Chang;,citation_author=Wenjie Cai;,citation_author=Jer-Horng Lin;,citation_author=Shing-Jong Huang;,citation_author=Qian-Yan Lin;,citation_author=Eric Chung-Yueh Yuan;,citation_author=Shu-Li Li;,citation_author=Ying-Chung Jimmy Lin;,citation_author=Jerry Chun Chung Chan;,citation_author=Cheng-Si Tsao;,citation_publication_date=2023-06;,citation_cover_date=2023-06;,citation_year=2023;,citation_doi=10.1038/s41477-023-01430-z;,citation_issn=2055-0278;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Nat.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Fourier transform Raman assignment of guaiacyl and syringyl marker bands for lignin determination;,citation_abstract=A near infrared fourier transform Raman (NIR-FTR) spectroscopic technique was utilized to characterize lignin in wood. The Raman bands for CC stretching derived from 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl (guaiacyl) nuclei and from 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxyphenyl (syringyl) nuclei exist independently. The NIR-FTR analysis of a series of lignin model compounds indicated that a syringyl band was shifted to a lower frequency compared to a guaiacyl band. This shift was also observed in chemically synthesized lignin (DHP). Syringyl DHP, in which all the aromatic nuclei consist of syringyl type, exhibited a CC stretching band at 1594 cm-1, while guaiacyl DHP exhibited the band at 1599 cm-1. These bands were designated as syringyl and guaiacyl marker bands, respectively. Chemical and physical treatment of hardwood and softwood exhibited different characteristics. One of the reasons is the chemical structure of lignin. Softwood mainly contains only guaiacyl lignin, while hardwood contains both guaiacyl and syringyl lignin, and the syringyl/guaiacyl (SG) ratio varies among species. Under high-resolution conditions (1 cm-1), the NIR-FTR spectra of 10 hardwoods (wood meal samples) revealed that both syringyl and guaiacyl marker bands existed. On the other hand, the spectra of softwoods contained only a guaiacyl marker bands existed. On the other hand, the spectra of softwoods contained only a guaiacyl marker band. The SG ratio in hardwood calculated from the peak area intensity ratio of two marker bands shows a linear relationship with the SG ratio obtained from conventional nitrobenzene oxidation analysis with the correlation factor&amp;amp;amp;gt;0.96. Furthermore, if peak component separation analysis was combined, low-resolution spectral data gave a similar SG ratio. Either syringyl of guaiacyl marker bands can be assigned in the NIR-FTR spectra of wood blocks (saw-cut surface).

The baculites mutant was isolated based on the absence of helical SCW patterns in ectopically-induced protoxylem vessel cells, and mature baculites plants exhibited an irregular xylem (irx) mutant phenotype in mature plants. A single nucleic acid substitution in the CELLULOSE SYNTHASE SUBUNIT 7 (CESA7) gene in baculites was identified: while the mutation was predicted to produce a C-terminal truncated protein, immunoblot analysis revealed that cesa7bac mutation results in loss of production of CESA7 proteins, indicating that baculites is a novel cesa7 loss-of-function mutant. In cesa7bac, despite a lack of patterned cellulose deposition, the helically-patterned deposition of other SCW components, such as the hemicellulose xylan and the phenolic polymer lignin, was not affected. Similar phenotypes were found in another point mutation mutant cesa7mur10-2, and an established knock-out mutant, cesa7irx3-4.

These transcription factors activate the transcription of genes required for secondary cell wall formation and programmed cell death, key events in xylem vessel element differentiation. Because constitutive overexpression of VND6 and VND7 induces ectopic xylem vessel element differentiation, functional studies of VND proteins have largely focused on these two proteins. Here, we report the roles of VND1, VND2, and VND3 in xylem vessel formation in cotyledons. Using our newly established in vitro system in which excised Arabidopsis cotyledons are stimulated to undergo xylem cell differentiation by cytokinin, auxin, and brassinosteroid treatment, we found that ectopic xylem vessel element differentiation required VND1, VND2, and VND3 but not VND6 or VND7.

We analyzed a receptor-like cytosolic kinase (RLCK) gene, ARCK1, whose expression was induced by abiotic stress. ARCK1 belongs to the cysteine-rich repeat (CRR) RLK sub-family and encodes a cytosolic protein kinase. The arck1 mutant showed higher sensitivity than the wild-type to ABA and osmotic stress during the post-germinative growth phase. CRK36, an abiotic stress-inducible RLK belonging to the CRR RLK sub-family, was screened as a potential interacting factor with ARCK1 by co-expression analyses and a yeast two-hybrid system. CRK36 physically interacted with ARCK1 in plant cells, and the kinase domain of CRK36 phosphorylated ARCK1 in vitro. We generated CRK36 RNAi transgenic plants, and found that transgenic plants with suppressed CRK36 expression showed higher sensitivity than arck1-2 to ABA and osmotic stress during the post-germinative growth phase. Microarray analysis using CRK36 RNAi plants revealed that suppression of CRK36 up-regulates several ABA-responsive genes, such as LEA genes, oleosin, ABI4 and ABI5. These results suggest that CRK36 and ARCK1 form a complex and negatively control ABA and osmotic stress signal transduction.;,citation_author=Hidenori Tanaka;,citation_author=Yuriko Osakabe;,citation_author=Shogo Katsura;,citation_author=Shinji Mizuno;,citation_author=Kyonoshin Maruyama;,citation_author=Kazuya Kusakabe;,citation_author=Junya Mizoi;,citation_author=Kazuo Shinozaki;,citation_author=Kazuko Yamaguchi-Shinozaki;,citation_publication_date=2012;,citation_cover_date=2012;,citation_year=2012;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1111/j.1365-313X.2012.04901.x;,citation_issn=1365-313X;,citation_volume=70;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Plant J.;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The maize brown Midrib2 (Bm2) gene encodes a methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase that contributes to lignin accumulation;,citation_abstract=The midribs of maize brown midrib (bm) mutants exhibit a reddish-brown color associated with reductions in lignin concentration and alterations in lignin composition. Here, we report the mapping, cloning, and functional and biochemical analyses of the bm2 gene. The bm2 gene was mapped to a small region of chromosome 1 that contains a putative methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene, which is down-regulated in bm2 mutant plants. Analyses of multiple Mu-induced bm2-Mu mutant alleles confirmed that this constitutively expressed gene is bm2. Yeast complementation experiments and a previously published biochemical characterization show that the bm2 gene encodes a functional MTHFR. Quantitative RT-PCR analyses demonstrated that the bm2 mutants accumulate substantially reduced levels of bm2 transcript. Alteration of MTHFR function is expected to influence accumulation of the methyl donor S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM). Because SAM is consumed by two methyltransferases in the lignin pathway (Ye et al., ), the finding that bm2 encodes a functional MTHFR is consistent with its lignin phenotype. Consistent with this functional assignment of bm2, the expression patterns of genes in a variety of SAM-dependent or -related pathways, including lignin biosynthesis, are altered in the bm2 mutant. Biochemical assays confirmed that bm2 mutants accumulate reduced levels of lignin with altered composition compared to wild-type. Hence, this study demonstrates a role for MTHFR in lignin biosynthesis.;,citation_author=Ho Man Tang;,citation_author=Sanzhen Liu;,citation_author=Sarah Hill-Skinner;,citation_author=Wei Wu;,citation_author=Danielle Reed;,citation_author=Cheng Ting Yeh;,citation_author=Dan Nettleton;,citation_author=Patrick S.

There is a lack of information on the ability of simple models available to predict these times for ventilated spaces with different geometries and ventilation configurations. Three analytical mixing time models, including a novel jet transit based approach, have been selected for comparison with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) predictions for a wide range of cuboidal rooms with ceiling ventilation. A modelling tool has been developed, using open source and open source based software, to automatically build and run a large number of Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes CFD models. The tool has been used to study the dependence of the chosen mixing metrics on room geometry and ventilation parameters, such as the air change rate, for a transient pollutant entering the room via the ventilation system. The room volume, shape, air change rate and vent layout were varied for each room using a Sobol sequence experimental design. The CFD tool has been used to assess the validity of the analytical mixing time models and to derive parameters for the scenarios of interest.

The coordination between transcriptional regulation of synthesis for each polymer is complex and vital to cell function. A regulatory hierarchy of developmental switches has been proposed, although the full complement of regulators remains unknown. Here we present a protein-DNA network between Arabidopsis thaliana transcription factors and secondary cell wall metabolic genes with gene expression regulated by a series of feed-forward loops.

Birch and sycamore seedlings exhibited contrasting patterns of leaf extension during a diurnal cycle with a 16 h photoperiod. Birch leaves grew more rapidly when illuminated; growth during the photoperiod was approximately doubled when compared with growth in the dark. Mean relative growth rates SE at “lights-on + 3 h” and “lights-off + 5 h” were 0.0136  0.0016 and 0.0066  0.0005 h-1 respectively.

When leaves of birch and sycamore were darkened, increased leaf turgor was measured in both species, but only in sycamore was this higher night-time turgor associated with a higher rate of leaf growth. Cell wall extensibility (WEX), an indication of the ability of cell walls to loosen and extend irreversibly, and cell surface pH were assessed in darkened and illuminated leaves of both species. An increase in WEX was measured when birch leaves were illuminated (P\leq 0.001) and this was accompanied by a decline in cell surface pH (P\leq 0.001). However, when leaves of sycamore were illuminated, WEX declined (P\leq 005) and cell surface pH increased (P\leq 0.001).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Dispersed lignin in tracheary elements treated with cellulose synthesis inhibitors provides evidence that molecules of the secondary cell wall mediate wall patterning;,citation_abstract=Mesophyll cells of Zinnia elegans var. Envy that had been induced to differentiate into tracheary elements (TEs) in suspension culture were treated with the cellulose synthesis inhibitor 2,6-dichlorobenzonitrile (DCB). The deposition of cellulose into the patterned secondary cell wall thickenings typical of TEs was inhibited as demonstrated by reduced incorporation of [14C]glucose into acetic/nitric insoluble material and absence of cellulose detectable by fluorescence after staining with Tinopal LPW, polarization optics, or labeling with a specific cellulase. Respiration as indicated by release of 14CO2 was inhibited to a much lesser extent, supporting a selective mechanism of action of DCB on the cellulose biosynthetic pathway. Patterned secondary cell wall thickenings were deposited in DCB-treated TEs, but these were smaller and less regularly shaped than those of control TEs. These cellulose-depleted thickenings lacked another abundant component of normal thickenings, the hemicellulose xylan, as indicated by absence of labeling with a specific xylanase or an antibody to xylan. DCB-treated TEs also showed dispersed lignin after staining with phloroglucinol, whereas control TEs contained lignin specifically localized to the secondary cell wall thickenings. Isoxaben, another recently described inhibitor of synthesis of acetic/nitric insoluble cell wall material (putatively cellulose), caused the same absence of detectable cellulose and xylan in the thickenings and dispersed lignin. These data suggest that: (i) the localization of lignin is ultimately dependent on the localization of cellulose; (ii) normal patterned wall assembly in TEs occurs in a self-perpetuating cascade in which some molecules of the secondary cell wall mediate patterning of others.;,citation_author=James G.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Identification of cellulose synthase AtCesA7 (IRX3) in vivo phosphorylation sites—a potential role in regulating protein degradation;,citation_abstract=Cellulose is central to plant development and is synthesised at the plasma membrane by an organised protein complex that contains three different cellulose synthase proteins. The ordered assembly of these three catalytic subunits is essential for normal cellulose synthesis. The way in which the relative levels of these three proteins are regulated within the cell is currently unknown. In this work it is shown that one of the cellulose synthases essential for secondary cell wall cellulose synthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana, AtCesA7, is phosphorylated in vivo. Analysis of in vivo phosphorylation sites by mass spectrometry reveals that two serine residues are phosphorylated. These residues occur in a region of hyper-variability between the cellulose synthase catalytic subunits. The region of the protein containing these phosphorylation sites can be phosphorylated by a plant extract in vitro. Incubation of this region with plant extracts results in its degradation via a proteasome dependant pathway. Full length endogenous CesA7 is also degraded via a proteasome dependant pathway in whole plant extracts. This data suggests that phosphorylation of the catalytic subunits may target them for degradation via a proteasome dependant pathway. This is a possible mechanism by which plants regulate the relative levels of the three proteins whose specific interaction are required to form an active cellulose synthase complex.;,citation_author=Neil G.

The hairy root cultures of Brassica juncea L. showed 92% decolorization of Methyl orange within 4 days. Out of the different redox mediators that were used to achieve enhanced decolorization, 2, 2’-Azinobis, 3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) was found to be the most efficient. Laccase activity of 4.5 U mg(-1) of protein was observed in hairy root cultures of Brassica juncea L., after the decolorization of Methyl orange. Intracellular laccase produced by B. juncea root cultures grown in MS basal medium was purified up to 2.0 fold with 6.62 U mg(-1) specific activity using anion-exchange chromatography. Molecular weight of the purified laccase was estimated to be 148 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The purified enzyme efficiently oxidized ABTS which was also required for oxidation of the other tested substrates. The pH and temperature optimum for laccase activity were 4.0 and 40^\circC, respectively. The purified enzyme was stable up to 50^\circC and was stable in the pH range of 4.0-6.0. Laccase activity was strongly inhibited by sodium azide, EDTA, dithiothreitol and L: -cysteine. The purified enzyme decolorized various textile dyes in the presence of ABTS as an efficient redox mediator.

Polysaccharide methylation takes place in the Golgi apparatus and therefore relies on the import of S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) from the cytosol into the Golgi. However, so far, no Golgi SAM transporter has been identified in plants. Here we studied major facilitator superfamily members in Arabidopsis that we identified as putative Golgi SAM transporters (GoSAMTs). Knockout of the two most highly expressed GoSAMTs led to a strong reduction in Golgi-synthesized polysaccharide methylation. Furthermore, solid-state NMR experiments revealed that reduced methylation changed cell wall polysaccharide conformations, interactions and mobilities. Notably, NMR revealed the existence of pectin “egg-box” structures in intact cell walls and showed that their formation is enhanced by reduced methyl esterification. These changes in wall architecture were linked to substantial growth and developmental phenotypes. In particular, anisotropic growth was strongly impaired in the double mutant. The identification of putative transporters involved in import of SAM into the Golgi lumen in plants provides new insights into the paramount importance of polysaccharide methylation for plant cell wall structure and function.;,citation_author=Henry Temple;,citation_author=Pyae Phyo;,citation_author=Weibing Yang;,citation_author=Jan J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Proposed supramolecular structure of lignin in softwood tracheid compound middle lamella regions;,citation_abstract=The structure of lignin in the compound middle lamella (CML) of softwood tracheids differs from that in the secondary wall (SW) in regard to the content of condensed structures (5-5\prime-biphenyl, dibenzodioxocin and 4-O-5\prime-diphenyl ether). In an early stage of cell wall formation, random coarse networks composed of thin cellulose microfibrils (CMFs), hemicelluloses, and pectin are formed in the CML, then globular p-hydroxyphenyl/guaiacyl lignin (HG-lignin) is deposited quickly into the network. The globular lignin is assumed to be a micellar aggregate of oligolignols folded at the \beta-O-4 bond with their phenolic ends on the outer part of the aggregate. When 3D clusters of the globules are deposited on the preformed network of polysaccharides, further growth of the oligolignols by endwise addition of new monolignols is spatially limited, so frequent condensation occurs between growing aromatic ends of adjacent HG-oligolignols within the globule and between the wide contact boundaries of the 3D clustered globules to produce a highly condensed supramolecule in CML. In SW, the folded G-oligolignols are deposited slowly in the narrow tubular space surrounding thick CMFs coated with hemicelluloses. Condensation occurs mostly between adjacent growing ends of the oligolignols within the tubular aggregates. Spatial regulation of condensation of folded polylignols is one of the factors producing a different supramolecular structure for CML lignin than for SW lignin. © 2012 by Walter de Gruyter Berlin Boston.;,citation_author=Noritsugu Terashima;,citation_author=Masato Yoshida;,citation_author=Jonas Hafrén;,citation_author=Kazuhiko Fukushima;,citation_author=Ulla Westermark;,citation_publication_date=2012;,citation_cover_date=2012;,citation_year=2012;,citation_issue=8;,citation_doi=10.1515/hf-2012-0021;,citation_isbn=0018-3830;,citation_issn=00183830;,citation_volume=66;,citation_journal_title=Holzforschung;">

Recently, it became a matter of debate whether those MLGs are real intermediates in lignin biosynthesis or only a storage form of monolignols outside of the main biosynthetic pathway. The latter is partly based on a misinterpretation of 14 C-tracer experiments and partly on the simple generalization of the results of gene manipulation experiments concerning the flexible and complex lignification. In the present paper, it could be confirmed by the most reliable 13 C-tracer method that MLGs are real intermediates in the pathway from l-phenylalanine to macromolecular lignin-polysaccharides complexes in the cell walls. This pathway via MLGs is essential for transport and programmed delivery of specific monolignols in a stable form from intracellular space to specific lignifying sites within the cell wall. The pool size of MLGs is large in most gymnosperm trees and some angiosperm species that emerged in an early stage of phylogeny, while the pool size is small in most angiosperms. This difference in pool size is reasonably understandable from the viewpoint of plant evolution, in the course of which the role of MLGs changed to meet variation in type of major cells, reaction wood formation, and postmortem lignification.;,citation_author=Noritsugu Terashima;,citation_author=Chisato Ko;,citation_author=Yasuyuki Matsushita;,citation_author=Ulla Westermark;,citation_publication_date=2016-09;,citation_cover_date=2016-09;,citation_year=2016;,citation_issue=9;,citation_doi=10.1515/hf-2015-0224;,citation_issn=1437-434X;,citation_volume=70;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Holzforschung;,citation_publisher=De Gruyter;">

Although cell wall composition is well understood, the cross-linking of the different polymers is only now yielding to investigation. Cross-linking between hemicelluloses and lignin occurs via two different mechanisms: incorporation into lignin by radical coupling of ferulate substitutions on xylan in commelinid monocots, and incorporation of hemicellulosic glycosyl residues by re-aromatisation of lignification intermediates. Recent genetic evidence indicates that hemicellulose:lignin cross-linking has a substantial impact on plant cell wall recalcitrance.

In Arabidopsis, one CCR gene (CCR1, At1g15950) and two CAD genes (CAD C At3g19450 and CAD D At4g34230) are involved in this pathway. A triple cad c cad d ccr1 mutant, named ccc, was obtained. This mutant displays a severe dwarf phenotype and male sterility. The lignin content in ccc mature stems is reduced to 50% of the wild-type level. In addition, stem lignin structure is severely affected, as shown by the dramatic enrichment in resistant inter-unit bonds and incorporation into the polymer of monolignol precursors such as coniferaldehyde, sinapaldehyde, and ferulic acid. Male sterility is due to the lack of lignification in the anther endothecium, which causes the failure of anther dehiscence and of pollen release. The ccc hypolignified stems accumulate higher amounts of flavonol glycosides, sinapoyl malate and feruloyl malate, which suggests a redirection of the phenolic pathway. Therefore, the absence of CAD and CCR, key enzymes of the monolignol pathway, has more severe consequences on the phenotype than the individual absence of each of them. Induction of another CCR (CCR2, At1g80820) and another CAD (CAD1, At4g39330) does not compensate the absence of the main CCR and CAD activities. This lack of CCR and CAD activities not only impacts lignification, but also severely affects the development of the plants. These consequences must be carefully considered when trying to reduce the lignin content of plants in order to facilitate the lignocellulose-to-bioethanol conversion process.;,citation_author=Johanne Thévenin;,citation_author=Brigitte Pollet;,citation_author=Bruno Letarnec;,citation_author=Luc Saulnier;,citation_author=Lionel Gissot;,citation_author=Alessandra Maia-Grondard;,citation_author=Catherine Lapierre;,citation_author=Lise Jouanin;,citation_publication_date=2011-01;,citation_cover_date=2011-01;,citation_year=2011;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1093/mp/ssq045;,citation_issn=1674-2052;,citation_volume=4;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Mol.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Endogenous Arabidopsis messenger RNAs transported to distant tissues;,citation_abstract=The concept that proteins and small RNAs can move to and function in distant body parts is well established. However, non- cell-autonomy of small RNA molecules raises the question: To what extent are protein-coding messenger RNAs (mRNAs) exchanged between tissues in plants? Here we report the comprehensive identification of 2,006 genes producing mobile RNAs in Arabidopsis thaliana. The analysis of variant ecotype transcripts that were present in heterografted plants allowed the identification of mRNAs moving between various organs under normal or nutrient-limiting conditions. Most of these mobile transcripts seem to follow the phloem-dependent allocation pathway transporting sugars from photosynthetic tissues to roots via the vasculature. Notably, a high number of transcripts also move in the opposite, root-to-shoot direction and are transported to specific tissues including flowers. Proteomic data on grafted plants indicate the presence of proteins from mobile RNAs, allowing the possibility that they may be translated at their destination site. The mobility of a high number of mRNAs suggests that a postulated tissue-specific gene expression profile might not be predictive for the actual plant body part in which a transcript exerts its function.;,citation_author=Christoph J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Auxins and the Growth of Roots;,citation_abstract=The effect of indole-3-acetic acid, a typical auxin, on the elongation of the main root of Avena and of Pisum is the same whether the root tip is present or not. The effect, however, is dependent on the direction in which the auxin is applied. When applied to the root from without, its elongation is inhibited in both plants. When the shoot is cut off and the auxin applied to the stump, the elongation of the root of Avena is slightly inhibited, that of Pisum slightly stimulated. Pisum roots to which indole-acetic acid solution is applied from without are inhibited in elongation even if the shoot, cotyledons, and root tip are all removed. The above three groups of facts disprove the theory of Czaja that auxin inhibits the elongation of roots because two streams of it are present. The inhibition is brought about by one single stream. Auxin which enters young Avena roots from the seed also inhibits root elongation. Hence auxin cannot act as a root-growth stimulating hormone in the early stages of development and is not therefore in any true sense a germination hormone as postulated by Cholodny. The formation of lateral branches on the main root of Pisum is controlled by, and dependent on, auxin. Isolated root tips in culture are inhibited both in elongation and in weight increase by indole-3-acetic acid. A tentative explanation for the differences between Avena and Pisum roots in their responses to applied auxins is brought forward. It is based mainly upon differences in their normal auxin content. According to this view, low concentrations of auxin applied to roots already poor in auxin may cause an acceleration of growth. In roots rich in auxin this cannot occur, and in such roots auxin is not a limiting factor in root branching.;,citation_author=Kenneth V.

METHODS: Six consecutive patients (1 man, 5 women; mean age, 45.5 years; age range, 34-51 years) who underwent a 3-T MRI examination for the evaluation of 7 paraclinoid carotid artery aneurysms were reviewed retrospectively. MRI scans were acquired using a T2 turbo-spin echo sequence with 2-mm thickness without gap on the coronal plane perpendicular to the diaphragma sellae. Identifications of the DDR, adjacent regional anatomic landmarks, and paraclinoid aneurysms were analyzed. The locations of the paraclinoid aneurysms were categorized into intradural (aneurysm neck and sac located above the DDR), transdural (aneurysm neck or sac were straddling the DDR), and extradural (aneurysm neck and sac located below the DDR). Interstudy agreement between computed tomographic angiography and 3-T MRI for the anatomic location of the paraclinoid aneurysms was assessed in 6 patients who underwent both examinations. RESULTS: In all cases, the DDR was clearly identified and the relationship between the DDR and the paraclinoid aneurysm was successfully determined on 3-T MRI. The aneurysm locations determined with 3-T MRI were 4 intradural and 3 extradural. A comparison between computed tomographic angiography and 3-T MRI revealed discordant anatomic locations in 3 aneurysms (3 of 6, 50%). CONCLUSION: Direct visualization of the DDR as well as precise evaluation of paraclinoid aneurysm location with high-resolution 3-T MRI is possible. This study shows that high-resolution 3-T MRI is an important means to determine the appropriate management for patients with paraclinoid aneurysms.;,citation_author=Jun Shigeto;,citation_author=Yoshitaka Itoh;,citation_author=Sakie Hirao;,citation_author=Kaori Ohira;,citation_author=Koki Fujita;,citation_author=Yuji Tsutsumi;,citation_publication_date=2015-04;,citation_cover_date=2015-04;,citation_year=2015;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1111/jipb.12334;,citation_isbn=1524-4040 (Electronic){\textbackslash}r0148-396X (Linking);,citation_issn=16729072;,citation_pmid=25644691;,citation_volume=57;,citation_journal_title=J.

Antisense down-regulation of constitutive and induced PPO expression results in hypersusceptibility to pathogens, suggesting a critical role for PPO-mediated phenolic oxidation in plant defense. However, the nature and extent of PPO induction and its contribution to resistance are unclear. In this study we examined the inducibility of the tomato PPO gene family. In mature plants PPO transcript levels systemically increased in young leaves (nodes 1–3) when mature leaflets (node 5) were injured. Transcripts hybridizing to PPO E/F-specific probes were the predominant wound-induced PPO mRNAs in young leaves. Analysis of PPO promoter: GUS fusion constructs shows that mechanical wounding and infection by fungal and bacterial pathogens induced transcription of PPO F. Different injuries, salicylic acid, ethylene, and jasmonates elicited distinct, cell-specific and developmental stage-specific patterns of PPO F expression. Whereas jasmonates and mechanical wounding significantly induced PPO F only in young leaves (nodes 1–3), and ethylene induced PPO F only in older leaves (node 7), salicylic acid induced PPO F in stems and foliage at all developmental stages. These results demonstrate that cis-element(s) sufficient for PPO F inducibility reside in the 5[prime] flanking region, and these elements are responsive to a broad range of signals.;,citation_author=P.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Antisense downregulation of polyphenol oxidase results in enhanced disease susceptibility;,citation_abstract=Polyphenol oxidases (PPOs; EC 1.14.18.1 or EC 1.10.3.2) catalyze the oxidation of phenolics to quinones, highly reactive intermediates whose secondary reactions are responsible for much of the oxidative browning that accompanies plant senescence, wounding, and responses to pathogens. To assess the impact of PPO expression on resistance to Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato we introduced a chimeric antisense potato PPO cDNA into tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum L.). Oxidation of caffeic acid, the dominant o-diphenolic aglycone of tomato foliage, was decreased ca. 40-fold by antisense expression of PPO. All members of the PPO gene family were downregulated: neither immunoreactive PPO nor PPO-specific mRNA were detectable in the transgenic plants. In addition, the antisense PPO construct suppressed inducible increases in PPO activity. Downregulation of PPO in antisense plants did not affect growth, development, or reproduction of greenhouse-grown plants. However, antisense PPO expression dramatically increased susceptibility to P. syringae expressing the avirulence gene avrPto in both Pto and pto backgrounds. In a compatible (pto) interaction, plants constitutively expressing an antisense PPO construct exhibited a 55-fold increase in bacterial growth, three times larger lesion area, and ten times more lesions cm(-2) than nontransformed plants. In an incompatible (Pto) interaction, antisense PPO plants exhibited 100-fold increases in bacterial growth and ten times more lesions cm(-2) than nontransformed plants. Although it is not clear whether hypersusceptibility of antisense plants is due to low constitutive PPO levels or failure to induce PPO upon infection, these findings suggest a critical role for PPO-catalyzed phenolic oxidation in limiting disease development. As a preliminary effort to understand the role of induced PPO in limiting disease development, we also examined the response of PPO promoter::beta-glucuronidase constructs when plants are challenged with P. syringae in both Pto and pto backgrounds. While PPO B inducibility was the same in both compatible and incompatible interactions, PPO D, E and F were induced to higher levels and with different expression patterns in incompatible interactions.;,citation_author=Piyada Thipyapong;,citation_author=Michelle D.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Maximum allowed solvent accessibilites of residues in proteins;,citation_abstract=The relative solvent accessibility (RSA) of a residue in a protein measures the extent of burial or exposure of that residue in the 3D structure. RSA is frequently used to describe a protein’s biophysical or evolutionary properties. To calculate RSA, a residue’s solvent accessibility (ASA) needs to be normalized by a suitable reference value for the given amino acid; several normalization scales have previously been proposed. However, these scales do not provide tight upper bounds on ASA values frequently observed in empirical crystal structures. Instead, they underestimate the largest allowed ASA values, by up to 20%. As a result, many empirical crystal structures contain residues that seem to have RSA values in excess of one. Here, we derive a new normalization scale that does provide a tight upper bound on observed ASA values. We pursue two complementary strategies, one based on extensive analysis of empirical structures and one based on systematic enumeration of biophysically allowed tripeptides. Both approaches yield congruent results that consistently exceed published values. We conclude that previously published ASA normalization values were too small, primarily because the conformations that maximize ASA had not been correctly identified. As an application of our results, we show that empirically derived hydrophobicity scales are sensitive to accurate RSA calculation, and we derive new hydrophobicity scales that show increased correlation with experimentally measured scales.;,citation_author=Matthew Z.

Energy-rich polysaccharide polymers of plant cell walls can be broken down to produce fermentable sugars used to produce bioethanol. However, the complex structure of plant cell walls, and in particular, the presence of lignin, makes them recalcitrant to enzymatic degradation. Reducing this recalcitrance represents a major technological challenge. Brachypodium distachyon is an excellent model to identify parameters underlying biomass quality of energy grasses. In this work, we identified a mutant line spa1 with a so far undescribed phenotype combining brittleness with increased elasticity of the internodes. Mutant cell walls contain less crystalline cellulose and changes in hemicellulose and lignin quality and quantity. Using a dedicated reactor to follow in real-time, the evolution of straw particle size and sugar release during enzymatic digestion, we show that, despite the increased lignin content, the spa1 mutant has a dramatic reduced recalcitrance to saccharification compared to the WT. These observations demonstrate that other parameters besides lignin content are relevant for the improvement of biomass recalcitrance in energy grasses.;,citation_author=Hélène Timpano;,citation_author=Richard Sibout;,citation_author=Marie-Françoise Devaux;,citation_author=Camille Alvarado;,citation_author=Rachelle Looten;,citation_author=Xavier Falourd;,citation_author=Bruno Pontoire;,citation_author=Marjolaine Martin;,citation_author=Frédéric Legée;,citation_author=Laurent Cézard;,citation_author=Catherine Lapierre;,citation_author=Eric Badel;,citation_author=Sylvie Citerne;,citation_author=Samantha Vernhettes;,citation_author=Herman Höfte;,citation_author=Fabienne Guillon;,citation_author=Martine Gonneau;,citation_publication_date=2015-03;,citation_cover_date=2015-03;,citation_year=2015;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1007/s12155-014-9501-1;,citation_issn=1939-1242;,citation_volume=8;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Bioenerg.

In this article, to examine the contribution of syringyl quinone methide intermediates (S-QM) on S-DHP production, horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-catalyzed dehydrogenative polymerization of S-alc was carried out in the presence of nucleophilic reagents that promote the rearomatization of S-QM. First, the HRP-catalyzed polymerization of sinapyl alcohol \gamma-O-\beta-D-glucopyranoside (isosyringin, iso-S), which allows us to monitor the polymerization process in a homogeneous aqueous phase, was utilized for screening of a nucleophile used as an S-QM scavenger. Monitoring of iso-S polymerization in the presence of various nucleophilic reagents by UV spectroscopy and gel permeation chromatography with photodiode array detection (GPC-PDA) revealed a high ability of azide ion to convert oligomeric S-QM efficiently to S-DHP. Accordingly, azide ion was utilized as an S-QM scavenger in HRP-catalyzed polymerization of S-alc, which resulted in high-yield production of S-DHPs (\sim83%), as expected. The 1H-, 13C-, and 2D-HSQC NMR investigations on the resulting S-DHPs clearly demonstrated that azide ion efficiently performed nucleophilic additions to the C-\alpha of S-QM during the polymerization. These results provide experimental proof that the low reactivity of S-QM with nucleophiles (such as water, phenolic, and aliphatic hydroxyl groups) in the conventional polymerization system critically impedes the production of S-DHPs from S-alc.;,citation_author=Yuki Tobimatsu;,citation_author=Toshiyuki Takano;,citation_author=Hiroshi Kamitakahara;,citation_author=Fumiaki Nakatsubo;,citation_publication_date=2010-06;,citation_cover_date=2010-06;,citation_year=2010;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1007/s10086-009-1086-5;,citation_issn=1611-4663;,citation_volume=56;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Visualization of plant cell wall lignification using fluorescence-tagged monolignols;,citation_abstract=Lignin is an abundant phenylpropanoid polymer produced by the oxidative polymerization of p-hydroxycinnamyl alcohols (monolignols). Lignification, i.e., deposition of lignin, is a defining feature of secondary cell wall formation in vascular plants, and provides an important mechanism for their disease resistance; however, many aspects of the cell wall lignification process remain unclear partly because of a lack of suitable imaging methods to monitor the process in vivo. In this study, a set of monolignol analogs \gamma-linked to fluorogenic aminocoumarin and nitrobenzofuran dyes were synthesized and tested as imaging probes to visualize the cell wall lignification process in Arabidopsis thaliana and Pinus radiata under various feeding regimens. In particular, we demonstrate that the fluorescence-tagged monolignol analogs can penetrate into live plant tissues and cells, and appear to be metabolically incorporated into lignifying cell walls in a highly specific manner. The localization of the fluorogenic lignins synthesized during the feeding period can be readily visualized by fluorescence microscopy and is distinguishable from the other wall components such as polysaccharides as well as the pre-existing lignin that was deposited earlier in development.;,citation_author=Yuki Tobimatsu;,citation_author=Armin Wagner;,citation_author=Lloyd Donaldson;,citation_author=Prajakta Mitra;,citation_author=Claudiu Niculaes;,citation_author=Oana Dima;,citation_author=Jeong Im Kim;,citation_author=Nickolas Anderson;,citation_author=Dominique Loque;,citation_author=Wout Boerjan;,citation_author=Clint Chapple;,citation_author=John Ralph;,citation_publication_date=2013;,citation_cover_date=2013;,citation_year=2013;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1111/tpj.12299;,citation_isbn=1365-313X;,citation_issn=09607412;,citation_pmid=23889038;,citation_volume=76;,citation_journal_title=Plant J.;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Coexistence but Independent Biosynthesis of Catechyl and Guaiacyl/Syringyl Lignin Polymers in Seed Coats;,citation_abstract=Lignins are phenylpropanoid polymers, derived from monolignols, commonly found in terrestrial plant secondary cell walls. We recently reported evidence of an unanticipated catechyl lignin homopolymer (C lignin) derived solely from caffeyl alcohol in the seed coats of several monocot and dicot plants. We previously identified plant seeds that possessed either C lignin or traditional guaiacyl/syringyl (G/S) lignins, but not both. Here, we identified several dicot plants (Euphorbiaceae and Cleomaceae) that produce C lignin together with traditional G/S lignins in their seed coats. Solution-state NMR analyses, along with an in vitro lignin polymerization study, determined that there is, however, no copolymerization detectable (i.e., that the synthesis and polymerization of caffeyl alcohol and conventional monolignols in vivo is spatially and/or temporally separated). In particular, the deposition of G and C lignins in Cleome hassleriana seed coats is developmentally regulated during seed maturation; C lignin appears successively after G lignin within the same testa layers, concurrently with apparent loss of the functionality of O-methyltransferases, which are key enzymes for the conversion of C to G lignin precursors.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Lignin polymerization: How do plants manage the chemistry so well?;,citation_abstract=The final step of lignin biosynthesis is the polymerization of monolignols in apoplastic cell wall domains. In this process, monolignols secreted by lignifying cells, or occasionally neighboring non-lignifying and/or other lignifying cells, are activated by cell-wall-localized oxidation systems, such as laccase/O2 and/or peroxidase/H2O2, for combinatorial radical coupling to make the final lignin polymers. Plants can precisely control when, where, and which types of lignin polymers are assembled at tissue and cellular levels, but do not control the polymers’ exact chemical structures per se. Recent studies have begun to identify specific laccase and peroxidase proteins responsible for lignin polymerization in specific cell types and during different developmental stages. The coordination of polymerization machinery localization and monolignol supply is likely critical for the spatio-temporal patterning of lignin polymerization.

In the process, we isolated ZPO-C, a peroxidase gene of Z. elegans that is expressed specifically in differentiating TEs. ZPO-C is suggested to be involved in lignification of Z. elegans TEs in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, a peroxidase gene of Arabidopsis thaliana (AtPrx66), which is homologous to ZPO-C, was identified. The expression profile and functions of the gene in planta remain to be investigated. In this study, we performed promoter::beta-glucuronidase (GUS) assays to investigate the expression profiles and functions of the ZPO-C-like peroxidases in A. thaliana. We generated transgenic A. thaliana lines carrying AtPrx66, AtPrx47 or AtPrx64 (peroxidases showing high sequence similarity to AtPrx66) promoter::GUS reporter gene fusions. The GUS activities of AtPrx66, AtPrx47 and AtPrx64 promoter::GUS lines were arranged concentrically from the center to the periphery in the roots of seedlings. Furthermore, histochemical GUS assays using inflorescence stems showed that AtPrx66, AtPrx47 and AtPrx64 promoter-driven GUS were mainly expressed in the differentiating vessels, xylem parenchyma and sclerenchyma, respectively. These results suggest that the gene expressions of these three peroxidases, which showed high sequence similarity to one another, are differentially regulated in various tissues and organs.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The polyphenol oxidase gene family in poplar: Phylogeny, differential expression and identification of a novel, vacuolar isoform;,citation_abstract=Polyphenol oxidases (PPOs) are oxidative enzymes that convert monophenols and o-diphenols to o-quinones using molecular oxygen. The quinone products are highly reactive following tissue damage and can interact with cellular constituents and cause oxidative browning and cross-linking. The induction of PPO in some plants as a result of wounding, herbivore attack, or pathogen infection has implicated them in defense. However, PPO-like enzymes that act as specific hydroxylases, for example in lignan and pigment biosynthesis, have also been discovered. Here, we present the first genome-enabled analysis of a PPO gene family. The Populus trichocarpa genome was found to contain a minimum of nine complete PPO genes, and seven of these were characterized further. The PPO gene family includes both recently duplicated and divergent sequences that are 36-98% identical at the amino acid level. Gene expression profiling in poplar tissues and organs revealed that the PPO genes are all differentially expressed during normal development, but that only a small subset of PPO genes are significantly upregulated by wounding, methyl jasmonate or pathogen infection. Our studies also identified PtrPPO13, a novel PPO gene that is predicted to encode an N-terminal signal peptide. Transient expression of green fluorescent protein fusions demonstrated its localization to the vacuolar lumen.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The polyphenol oxidase gene family in land plants: Lineage-specific duplication and expansion;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Plant polyphenol oxidases (PPOs) are enzymes that typically use molecular oxygen to oxidize ortho-diphenols to ortho-quinones. These commonly cause browning reactions following tissue damage, and may be important in plant defense. Some PPOs function as hydroxylases or in cross-linking reactions, but in most plants their physiological roles are not known. To better understand the importance of PPOs in the plant kingdom, we surveyed PPO gene families in 25 sequenced genomes from chlorophytes, bryophytes, lycophytes, and flowering plants. The PPO genes were then analyzed in silico for gene structure, phylogenetic relationships, and targeting signals.\n\nRESULTS: Many previously uncharacterized PPO genes were uncovered. The moss, Physcomitrella patens, contained 13 PPO genes and Selaginella moellendorffii (spike moss) and Glycine max (soybean) each had 11 genes. Populus trichocarpa (poplar) contained a highly diversified gene family with 11 PPO genes, but several flowering plants had only a single PPO gene. By contrast, no PPO-like sequences were identified in several chlorophyte (green algae) genomes or Arabidopsis (A. lyrata and A. thaliana). We found that many PPOs contained one or two introns often near the 3’ terminus. Furthermore, N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis using ChloroP and TargetP 1.1 predicted that several putative PPOs are synthesized via the secretory pathway, a unique finding as most PPOs are predicted to be chloroplast proteins. Phylogenetic reconstruction of these sequences revealed that large PPO gene repertoires in some species are mostly a consequence of independent bursts of gene duplication, while the lineage leading to Arabidopsis must have lost all PPO genes.\n\nCONCLUSION: Our survey identified PPOs in gene families of varying sizes in all land plants except in the genus Arabidopsis. While we found variation in intron numbers and positions, overall PPO gene structure is congruent with the phylogenetic relationships based on primary sequence data. The dynamic nature of this gene family differentiates PPO from other oxidative enzymes, and is consistent with a protein important for a diversity of functions relating to environmental adaptation.;,citation_author=Lan T Tran;,citation_author=John S Taylor;,citation_author=C Peter Constabel;,citation_publication_date=2012;,citation_cover_date=2012;,citation_year=2012;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1186/1471-2164-13-395;,citation_isbn=1471-2164 (Electronic){\textbackslash}r1471-2164 (Linking);,citation_issn=1471-2164;,citation_pmid=22897796;,citation_volume=13;,citation_journal_title=Bmc Genomics;">

However, this method has been applied only in Arabidopsis thaliana and Brachypodium distachyon thus far. Results from freeze fracture electron microscopy of protonemal filaments of the moss Funaria hygrometrica indicate that a cellulose synthesis inhibitor, 2,6-dichlorobenzonitrile (DCB), fragments CSCs and clears them from the plasma membrane. This differs from Arabidopsis, in which DCB causes CSC accumulation in the plasma membrane and a different cellulose synthesis inhibitor, isoxaben, clears CSCs from the plasma membrane. In this study, live cell imaging of the moss Physcomitrella patens indicated that DCB and isoxaben have little effect on protonemal growth rates, and that only DCB causes tip rupture. Live cell imaging of mEGFP-PpCESA5 and mEGFP-PpCESA8 showed that DCB and isoxaben substantially reduced CSC movement, but had no measureable effect on CSC density in the plasma membrane. These results suggest that DCB and isoxaben have similar effects on CSC movement in P. patens and Arabidopsis, but have different effects on CSC intracellular trafficking, cell growth and cell integrity in these divergent plant lineages.;,citation_author=Mai L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Sites of Cellulose Synthesis in Algae: Diversity and Evolution of Cellulose-Synthesizing Enzyme Complexes;,citation_abstract=Information on the sites of cellulose synthesis and the diversity and evolution of cellulose-synthesizing enzyme complexes (terminal complexes) in algae is reviewed. There is now ample evidence that cellulose synthesis occurs at the plasma membrane-bound cellulose synthase, with the exception of some algae that produce cellulosic scales in the Golgi apparatus. Freeze-fracture studies of the supramolecular organization of the plasma membrane support the view that the rosettes (a six-subunit complex) in higher plants and both the rosettes and the linear terminal complexes (TCs) in algae are the structures that synthesize cellulose and secrete cellulose microfibrils. In the Zygnemataceae, each single rosette forms a 5-nm or 3-nm single “elementary” microfibril (primary wall), whereas rosettes arranged in rows of hexagonal arrays synthesize criss-crossed bands of parallel cellulose microfibrils (secondary wall). In Spirogyra, it is proposed that each of the six subunits of a rosette might synthesize six \beta-1,4-glucan chains that cocrystallize into a 36-glucan chain “elementary” microfibril, as is the case in higher plants. One typical feature of the linear terminal complexes in red algae is the periodic arrangement of the particle rows transverse to the longitudinal axis of the TCs. In bangiophyte red algae and in Vaucheria hamata, cellulose microfibrils are thin, ribbon-shaped structures, 1–1.5 nm thick and 5–70 nm wide; details of their synthesis are reviewed. Terminal complexes appear to be made in the endoplasmic reticulum and are transferred to Golgi cisternae, where the cellulose synthases are activated and may be transported to the plasma membrane. In algae with linear TCs, deposition follows a precise pattern directed by the movement and the orientation of the TCs (membrane flow). A principal underlying theme is that the architecture of cellulose microfibrils (size, shape, crystallinity, and intramicrofibrillar associations) is directly related to the geometry of TCs. The effects of inhibitors on the structure of cellulose-synthetizing complexes and the relationship between the deposition of the cellulose microfibrils with cortical microtubules and with the membrane-embedded TCs is reviewed In Porphyra yezoensis, the frequency and distribution of TCs reflect polar tip growth in the apical shoot cell.The evolution of TCs in algae is reviewed.

However, only a few natural substrates have been identified, mainly because of the previous lack of sensitive proteomics technologies enabling the identification of low abundant proteins, together with a delay in the implementation of these technologies in the field of plant research. Here, we review the current knowledge on the identity of natural plant protease substrates and describe recently established degradomics technologies that should allow proteome-wide studies of plant proteases in the near future.;,citation_author=Liana Tsiatsiani;,citation_author=Kris Gevaert;,citation_author=Frank Van Breusegem;,citation_publication_date=2012;,citation_cover_date=2012;,citation_year=2012;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1111/j.1399-3054.2011.01534.x;,citation_isbn=1399-3054 (Electronic){\textbackslash}r0031-9317 (Linking);,citation_issn=00319317;,citation_pmid=22008056;,citation_volume=145;,citation_journal_title=Physiol.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Unexpected behavior of coniferin in lignin biosynthesis of ginkgo biloba L;,citation_abstract=To gain insight into the behavior of monolignol glucoside in Ginkgo biloba L., we examined glucosides potentially involved in lignin biosynthetic pathway. Coniferin (coniferyl alcohol 4O-\beta-D-glucoside) is a strong candidate for the storage form of monolignol. Coniferaldehyde glucoside may also have a role in lignin biosynthesis; this was examined with tracer experiments using labeled glucosides fed to stem segments. A series of tracer experiments showed that coniferin and coniferaldehyde glucoside were modified into coniferyl alcohol and then efficiently incorporated into lignin under the experimental conditions used. Interestingly, more than half of the administered coniferin underwent an oxidation to the aldehyde form before its aglycone; coniferyl alcohol was polymerized into lignin. This suggests that there is an alternative pathway for coniferin to enter the monolignol biosynthetic pathway, in addition to the direct pathway beginning with the deglucosylation of coniferin catalyzed by \beta-glucosidase. Enzymatic assays revealed that coniferaldehyde glucoside was produced enzymatically from coniferin, and that coniferaldehyde glucoside can be deglucosylated to yield coniferaldehyde, which could be fated to become coniferyl alcohol . Albeit the findings cannot be taken as proof for the in-planta functioning, these results present a possibility for the existence of alternative pathway in which some of the stored coniferin is oxidized to coniferaldehyde glucoside, which is deglucosylated to generate coniferaldehyde that joins the monolignol biosynthesis pathway.;,citation_author=Yukiko Tsuji;,citation_author=Fang Chen;,citation_author=Seiichi Yasuda;,citation_author=Kazuhiko Fukushima;,citation_publication_date=2005-09;,citation_cover_date=2005-09;,citation_year=2005;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1007/s00425-005-1517-5;,citation_issn=1432-2048;,citation_volume=222;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Planta;">

The Gram-negative bacterium Sphingobium sp.

We explored the possibility of using LigD for biosynthetically engineering lignin by expressing the codon-optimized ligD gene in Arabidopsis thaliana. The ligD cDNA, with or without a signal peptide for apoplast targeting, has been successfully expressed, and LigD activity could be detected in the extracts of the transgenic plants. UPLC-MS/MS-based metabolite profiling indicated that levels of oxidized guaiacyl (G) \beta-O-4-coupled dilignols and analogues were significantly elevated in the LigD transgenic plants regardless of the signal peptide attachment to LigD.

The biosynthesis of lignin proceeds in the cell wall by polymerization of precursors; the initial step of lignin polymerization is the transportation of lignin monomers from the cytosol to the cell wall, which is critical for lignin formation. There has been much debate on the transported form of the lignin precursor, either as free monolignols or their glucosides. In this study, we performed biochemical analyses to characterize the membrane transport mechanism of lignin precursors using angiosperms, hybrid poplar (Populus sieboldii  Populus grandidentata) and poplar (Populus sieboldii), as well gymnosperms, Japanese cypress (Chamaecyparis obtusa) and pine (Pinus densiflora). Membrane vesicles prepared from differentiating xylem tissues showed clear ATP-dependent transport activity of coniferin, whereas less than 4% of the coniferin transport activity was seen for coniferyl alcohol. Bafilomycin A1 and proton gradient erasers markedly inhibited coniferin transport in hybrid poplar membrane vesicles; in contrast, vanadate had no effect. Cis-inhibition experiments suggested that this transport activity was specific for coniferin. Membrane fractionation of hybrid poplar microsomes demonstrated that transport activity was localized to the tonoplast- and endomembrane-rich fraction. Differentiating xylem of Japanese cypress exhibited almost identical transport properties, suggesting the involvement of a common endomembrane-associated proton/coniferin antiport mechanism in the lignifying tissues of woody plants, both angiosperms and gymnosperms.;,citation_author=T.

The present study showed that a certain amount of coniferyl alcohol glucoside (coniferin) occurred in the differentiating xylem of Japanese cypress (Chamaecyparis obtusa), as previously reported in gymnosperms. Coniferin content peaked in the early stages of secondary wall formation and decreased during lignification. In contrast to gymnosperms, coniferin content was limited in the differentiating xylem of poplar (Populus sieboldii 9 Populus grandidentata). Moreover, coniferyl alcohol was not detected in all specimens. In the differentiating xylem of poplar, a higher amount of sinapyl alcohol occurred than glucoside (syringin). However, the phloem contained syringin and not sinapyl alcohol. The sinapyl alcohol content in the xylem peaked in the cells with ceasing cell wall formation, and decreased gradually towards the boundary of the annual ring, where the lignin content kept increasing.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Proton Gradient-Dependent Transport of p-Glucocoumaryl Alcohol in Differentiating Xylem of Woody Plants;,citation_abstract=Lignin is a cell wall component of vascular plants crucial for survival in terrestrial environments. While p-hydroxyphenyl lignin is minor, it is considered to be localised in the outermost part of the cell wall providing strong adhesion between cells, which determines cell shape. Transport of the lignin precursor from the cytosol to the cell wall is critical to regulate temporal and spatial lignin deposition; however, little information on the transport step is available. Here, we report transport activity of p-glucocoumaryl alcohol, a precursor of p-hydroxyphenyl lignin, in a broad-leaved tree (hybrid poplar, Populus sieboldii  P. grandidentata) and a coniferous tree (Japanese cypress, Chamaecyparis obtusa). Membrane vesicles of both trees were prepared from differentiating xylem with vigorous lignification and used for transport assays. Several inhibition assays indicated that not ABC transporters but the proton gradient&nbsp;and V-ATPase are involved in p-glucocoumaryl alcohol transport depending on ATP. These results support the hypothesis that p-glucocoumaryl alcohol is loaded into the secretory vesicles and delivered to the cell wall by exocytosis.

The relatedness of LAP-N and LAP-A was determined using affinity-purified antibodies to four LAP-A protein domains. Antibodies to epitopes in the most N-terminal region were able to discriminate between LAP-A and LAP-N, whereas antibodies recognizing central and COOH-terminal regions recognized both LAP polypeptides. Two-dimensional immunoblots showed that LAP-N and the LAP-like proteins were detected in all vegetative (leaves, stems, roots, and cotyledons) and reproductive (pistils, sepals, petals, stamens, and floral buds) organs examined, whereas LAP-A exhibited a distinct expression program. LapN was a single-copy gene encoding a rare-class transcript. A full-length LapN cDNA clone was isolated, and the deduced sequence had 77% peptide sequence identity with the wound-induced LAP-A. Comparison of LAP-N with other plant LAPs identified 28 signature residues that classified LAP proteins as LAP-N or LAP-A like. Overexpression of a His(6)-LAP-N fusion protein in Escherichia coli demonstrated distinct differences in His(6)-LAP-N and His(6)-LAP-A activities. Similar to LapA, the LapN RNA encoded a precursor protein with a molecular mass of 60 kD. The 5-kD presequence had features similar to plastid transit peptides, and processing of the LAP-N presequence could generate the mature 55-kD LAP-N. Unlike LapA, the LapN transcript contained a second in-frame ATG, and utilization of this potential initiation codon would yield a 55-kD LAP-N protein. The localization of LAP-N could be controlled by the balance of translational initiation site utilization and LAP-N preprotein processing.;,citation_author=Chao-Jung Tu;,citation_author=Sang-Youl Park;,citation_author=Linda L Walling;,citation_publication_date=2003;,citation_cover_date=2003;,citation_year=2003;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1104/pp.102.013854;,citation_issn=0032-0889;,citation_pmid=12746529;,citation_volume=132;,citation_journal_title=Plant Physiol.;">

Less is known regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying the terminal transition to xylem cell differentiation. Here, we generate whole-root and single-cell data, which demonstrate that VND7 initiates sharp switching of root cells to xylem cell identity. Based on these data, we identified 4 candidate VND7 downstream target genes capable of generating this switch. Although MYB46 responds to VND7 induction, it is not among these targets.

To begin to explore their roles in planta, spatial and temporal expression patterns of Arabidopsis laccases were compared and contrasted in different tissues at various development stages using RT-PCR and promoter-GUS fusions. Various cell-specific expressions were noted where specific laccases were uniquely expressed, such as LAC4 in interfascicular fibers and seed coat columella, LAC7 in hydathodes and root hairs, LAC8 in pollen grains and phloem, and LAC15 in seed coat cell walls. Such specific cell-type expression patterns provide new leads and/or strategies into determining their precise physiological/biochemical roles. In addition, there was an apparent redundancy of gene expression patterns for several laccases across a wide variety of tissues, lignified and non-lignified, perhaps indicative of overlapping function(s). Preliminary evidence, based on bioinformatics analyses, suggests that most laccases may also be tightly regulated at both transcriptional (antisense transcripts, histone and DNA methylation) and posttranscriptional (microRNAs) levels of gene expression.;,citation_author=Phanikanth V.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Collapsed Xylem Phenotype of Arabidopsis Identifies Mutants Deficient in Cellulose Deposition in the Secondary Cell Wall;,citation_abstract=Recessive mutations at three loci cause the collapse of mature xylem cells in inflorescence stems of Arabidopsis. These irregular xylem (irx) mutations were identified by screening plants from a mutagenized population by microscopic examination of stem sections. The xylem cell defect was associated with an up to eightfold reduction in the total amount of cellulose in mature inflorescence stems. The amounts of cell wall-associated phenolics and polysaccharides were unaffected by the mutations. Examination of the cell walls by using electron microscopy demonstrated that the decreases in cellulose content of irx lines resulted in an alteration of the spatial organization of cell wall material. This suggests that a normal pattern of cellulose deposition may be required for assembly of lignin or polysaccharides. The reduced cellulose content of the stems also resulted in a decrease in stiffness of the stem material. This is consistent with the irregular xylem phenotype and suggests that the walls of irx plants are not resistant to compressive forces. Because lignin was implicated previously as a major factor in resistance to compressive forces, these results suggest either that cellulose has a direct role in providing resistance to compressive forces or that it is required for the development of normal lignin structure. The irx plants had a slight reduction in growth rate and stature but were otherwise normal in appearance.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Other Functional Adaptations;,citation_abstract=The subject matter of this book is multi-dimensionally related in so many different ways that it is difficult to accommodate it logically in a one-dimensional text representation that proceeds linearly. The organization of the subject material into chapters and sections has therefore been somewhat arbitrary. Frequent cross-references help to restore some of the multi-dimensionality. There are nevertheless topics which do not fit easily into the linear text sequence and so some of these have been gathered in this chapter under the heading, Other Functional Adaptations. The chapter has thus become rather a collection of odds and ends. Functional adaptation is a very attractive topic for botanists who are interested in xylem evolution, but it tempts many to walk on thin ice. Arber (1920) wrote: “One of the unfortunate results, which followed the publication of The Origin of the Species, was the acutely teleological turn thus given to the thoughts of biologists. On the theory that every existing organ and structure either has, or has had in the past, a special adaptive purpose and ‘survival value’, it readily becomes a recognized habit to draw deductions as to function from structure, without checking such deductions experimentally.” Too many structural features have more than a single function, and too many functions depend on several factors. Correlations become therefore easily unreliable and one begins to speculate wildly. However, there is more to it: random mutations may produce structural features that are functionally rather unimportant. It is rather futile to try to interpret such features for their adaptive value (van Steenis 1969; Baas 1976). Nevertheless, we must learn a great deal more about wood function before we can begin to speculate about adaptation. I suppose we are all entitled to a certain amount of speculation, although I normally prefer to reduce questions to basic simplicity, thus making them accessible to experimental tests. This chapter is the place where I have most often disregarded my principle.;,citation_author=Melvin T. Tyree;,citation_author=M. H. Zimmermann;,citation_editor=Melvin T. Tyree;,citation_editor=M. H.

This deviation differs in successive layers of the xylem; the vessels form a network. This has been known to foresters on a macroscopic scale as “cross grain”. Cross grain was considered an exceptional characteristic of certain species. We know today that virtually all xylem is microscopically “cross grained” in respect to the path of their vessels. This was described first by Braun (1959). He meticulously reconstructed the vessel network of Populus from a series of transverse sections and showed the structure in a block of the dimensions 0.312.5 mm. He also described the nature of vessel ends. Vessel ends are not easy to recognize, particularly not in single sections. They have occasionally been “seen” where India ink infusions terminated. However, this is by no means reliable, because India ink particles are quite large and ragged; lateral water loss from the vessels concentrates them, and they may clog the vessels somewhere midway. Anyone who has tried to fill a fountain pen with India ink will heartily agree! Vessel ends have occasionally been reported as terminal elements in macerations (e.g., elements that have a perforation only at one end; Handley 1936; Bierhorst and Zamora 1965).

The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged \geq60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event.

On the basis of levels of enzyme activity and percentage of similarity between protein sequences, the laccases from strains BRFM 938, BRFM 66 and BRFM 902 were selected for purification and characterization. Each BRFM 938, BRFM 66 and BRFM 902 laccase gene encoded a predicted protein of 518 amino acids; the three deduced proteins showed 68.7-97.5% similarity with other Polyporale laccases. The three laccases (59.5-62.9 kDa with 7-10% carbohydrate content) had high redox potentials (0.72-0.75 V vs normal hydrogen electrode at pH 6), remained highly stable up to 75-78 degrees C and at pH 5-7 mixtures, and were resistant to methyl and ethyl alcohols, acetonitrile and dimethylsulfoxide at concentrations as high as 50% (v/v). The best laccase-1-hydroxybenzotriazole systems permitted almost 100% of various polyphenolic dye decolourization and oxidation of adlerol and veratryl alcohol.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The three laccases showed complementary biochemical features. BRFM 938 laccase had the highest thermo- and pH stability, catalytic efficiency towards 2,2’-azino-bis-[3-ethylthiazoline-6-sulfonate] and resistance to alcoholic solvents. BRFM 66 laccase had the highest rates of dye decolourization and oxidation of nonphenolic compounds.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study identified P. coccineus and P. sanguineus as outstanding producers of high redox potential laccases, easy to purify and scale-up for industrial production.

PD conductivity is regulated by endogenous and exogenous signals. However, the underlying signaling mechanisms remain enigmatic. In Arabidopsis, signal transduction mediated by the receptor-like kinase STRUBBELIG (SUB) contributes to inter-cell layer signaling during tissue morphogenesis. Previous analysis has revealed that SUB acts non-cell-autonomously suggesting that SUB controls tissue morphogenesis by participating in the formation or propagation of a downstream mobile signal. A genetic screen identified QUIRKY (QKY), encoding a predicted membrane-anchored C2-domain protein, as a component of SUB signaling. Here, we provide further insight into the role of QKY in this process. We show that like SUB, QKY exhibits non-cell-autonomy when expressed in a tissue-specific manner and that non-autonomy of QKY extends across several cells. In addition, we report on localization studies indicating that QKY and SUB localize to PD but independently of each other. FRET-FLIM analysis suggests that SUB and QKY are in close contact at PD in vivo.

Immune cells play important roles in wound healing by following instructions from the microenvironment. Here, we developed a technology to bioengineer the wound microenvironment and enhance healing abilities of the immune cells. This resulted in strongly accelerated wound healing and was achieved by transforming Lactobacilli with a plasmid encoding CXCL12. CXCL12-delivering bacteria administrated topically to wounds in mice efficiently enhanced wound closure by increasing proliferation of dermal cells and macrophages, and led to increased TGF-\beta expression in macrophages. Bacteria-produced lactic acid reduced the local pH, which inhibited the peptidase CD26 and consequently enhanced the availability of bioactive CXCL12. Importantly, treatment with CXCL12-delivering Lactobacilli also improved wound closure in mice with hyperglycemia or peripheral ischemia, conditions associated with chronic wounds, and in a human skin wound model. Further, initial safety studies demonstrated that the topically applied transformed bacteria exerted effects restricted to the wound, as neither bacteria nor the chemokine produced could be detected in systemic circulation. Development of drugs accelerating wound healing is limited by the proteolytic nature of wounds. Our technology overcomes this by on-site chemokine production and reduced degradation, which together ensure prolonged chemokine bioavailability that instructed local immune cells and enhanced wound healing.;,citation_author=Evelina Vågesjö;,citation_author=Emelie Öhnstedt;,citation_author=Anneleen Mortier;,citation_author=Hava Lofton;,citation_author=Fredrik Huss;,citation_author=Paul Proost;,citation_author=Stefan Roos;,citation_author=Mia Phillipson;,citation_publication_date=2018;,citation_cover_date=2018;,citation_year=2018;,citation_doi=10.1073/pnas.1716580115;,citation_issn=0027-8424;,citation_pmid=29432190;,citation_journal_title=Proc.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Cellulase KORRIGAN Is Part of the Cellulose Synthase Complex;,citation_abstract=Plant growth and organ formation depend on the oriented deposition of load-bearing cellulose microfibrils in the cell wall.

Cellulose synthesis in plants or bacteria also requires the activity of an endo-1,4-\beta-d-glucanase, the exact function of which in the synthesis process is not known. Here, we show, to our knowledge for the first time, that a leaky mutation in the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) membrane-bound endo-1,4-\beta-d-glucanase KORRIGAN1 (KOR1) not only caused reduced CSC movement in the plasma membrane but also a reduced cellulose synthesis inhibitor-induced accumulation of CSCs in intracellular compartments. This suggests a role for KOR1 both in the synthesis of cellulose microfibrils and in the intracellular trafficking of CSCs. Next, we used a multidisciplinary approach, including live cell imaging, gel filtration chromatography analysis, split ubiquitin assays in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae NMY51), and bimolecular fluorescence complementation, to show that, in contrast to previous observations, KOR1 is an integral part of the primary cell wall CSC in the plasma membrane.;,citation_author=Thomas Vain;,citation_author=Elizabeth Faris Crowell;,citation_author=Hélène Timpano;,citation_author=Eric Biot;,citation_author=Thierry Desprez;,citation_author=Nasim Mansoori;,citation_author=Luisa M.

We tested the hypothesis of an active, plasma membrane-localized transport of monolignol monomers, dimers, and/or glucosidic forms with membrane vesicles prepared from developing xylem and lignin-forming tissue-cultured cells of Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.), as well as from control materials, comprising non-lignifying Norway spruce phloem and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) BY-2 cells. Xylem and BY-2 vesicles transported both coniferin and p-coumaryl alcohol glucoside, but inhibitor assays suggested that this transport was through the tonoplast. Membrane vesicles prepared from lignin-forming spruce cells showed coniferin transport, but the Km value for coniferin was much higher than those of xylem and BY-2 cells. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of membrane proteins isolated from spruce developing xylem, phloem, and lignin-forming cultured cells revealed multiple transporters. These were compared with a transporter gene set obtained by a correlation analysis with a selected set of spruce monolignol biosynthesis genes.

However, because cellulose is embedded in a matrix of other polysaccharides and lignin, its hydrolysis into the fermentable glucose is hampered. The senesced inflorescence stems of a set of 20 Arabidopsis thaliana mutants in 10 different genes of the lignin biosynthetic pathway were analyzed for cell wall composition and saccharification yield. Saccharification models were built to elucidate which cell wall parameters played a role in cell wall recalcitrance.\n\nRESULTS: Although lignin is a key polymer providing the strength necessary for the plant’s ability to grow upward, a reduction in lignin content down to 64% of the wild-type level in Arabidopsis was tolerated without any obvious growth penalty. In contrast to common perception, we found that a reduction in lignin was not compensated for by an increase in cellulose, but rather by an increase in matrix polysaccharides. In most lignin mutants, the saccharification yield was improved by up to 88% cellulose conversion for the cinnamoyl-coenzyme A reductase1 mutants under pretreatment conditions, whereas the wild-type cellulose conversion only reached 18%. The saccharification models and Pearson correlation matrix revealed that the lignin content was the main factor determining the saccharification yield. However, also lignin composition, matrix polysaccharide content and composition, and, especially, the xylose, galactose, and arabinose contents influenced the saccharification yield. Strikingly, cellulose content did not significantly affect saccharification yield.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Although the lignin content had the main effect on saccharification, also other cell wall factors could be engineered to potentially increase the cell wall processability, such as the galactose content. Our results contribute to a better understanding of the effect of lignin perturbations on plant cell wall composition and its influence on saccharification yield, and provide new potential targets for genetic improvement.;,citation_author=Rebecca Van Acker;,citation_author=Ruben Vanholme;,citation_author=Véronique Storme;,citation_author=Jennifer C Mortimer;,citation_author=Paul Dupree;,citation_author=Wout Boerjan;,citation_publication_date=2013;,citation_cover_date=2013;,citation_year=2013;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1186/1754-6834-6-46;,citation_isbn=1754-6834;,citation_issn=1754-6834;,citation_pmid=23622268;,citation_volume=6;,citation_journal_title=Biotechnol.

Wood samples were classified according to the intensity of the red xylem coloration typically associated with CCR down-regulation. Saccharification assays under different pretreatment conditions (none, two alkaline, and one acid pretreatment) and simultaneous saccharification and fermentation assays showed that wood from the most affected transgenic trees had up to 161% increased ethanol yield. Fermentations of combined material from the complete set of 20-mo-old CCR-down-regulated trees, including bark and less efficiently down-regulated trees, still yielded \sim 20% more ethanol on a weight basis.

Exactly the recalcitrance and hydrophobicity of lignin put a burden on the industrial processing efficiency of lignocellulosic biomass. Both forward and reverse genetic strategies have been used intensively to unravel the molecular mechanism of lignin deposition. As an alternative strategy, we introduce here a forward chemical genetic approach to find candidate inhibitors of lignification. A high-throughput assay to assess lignification in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) seedlings was developed and used to screen a 10-k library of structurally diverse, synthetic molecules. Of the 73 compounds that reduced lignin deposition, 39 that had a major impact were retained and classified into five clusters based on the shift they induced in the phenolic profile of Arabidopsis seedlings. One representative compound of each cluster was selected for further lignin-specific assays, leading to the identification of an aromatic compound that is processed in the plant into two fragments, both having inhibitory activity against lignification. One fragment, p-iodobenzoic acid, was further characterized as a new inhibitor of CINNAMATE 4-HYDROXYLASE, a key enzyme of the phenylpropanoid pathway synthesizing the building blocks of the lignin polymer. As such, we provide proof of concept of this chemical biology approach to screen for inhibitors of lignification and present a broad array of putative inhibitors of lignin deposition for further characterization.;,citation_author=Dorien Van de Wouwer;,citation_author=Ruben Vanholme;,citation_author=Raphaël Decou;,citation_author=Geert Goeminne;,citation_author=Dominique Audenaert;,citation_author=Long Nguyen;,citation_author=René Höfer;,citation_author=Edouard Pesquet;,citation_author=Bartel Vanholme;,citation_author=Wout Boerjan;,citation_publication_date=2016-09;,citation_cover_date=2016-09;,citation_year=2016;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1104/pp.16.00430;,citation_isbn=0000000272;,citation_issn=0032-0889;,citation_pmid=27485881;,citation_volume=172;,citation_journal_title=Plant Physiol.;">

First, 12C and 13C lignin were isolated from nonlabeled and uniformly 13C labeled wheat straw, respectively, and characterized by heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and py-GC/MS. The two lignin isolates were found to have identical structures. Second, 13C-IS based lignin quantification by py-GC-SIM-MS was validated in reconstituted biomass model systems with known contents of the 12C lignin analogue and was shown to be extremely accurate (&amp;amp;amp;gt;99.9%, R2 &amp;gt; 0.999) and precise (RSD &amp;lt; 1.5%). Third, 13C-IS based lignin quantification was applied to four common poaceous biomass sources (wheat straw, barley straw, corn stover, and sugar cane bagasse), and lignin contents were in good agreement with the total gravimetrically determined lignin contents. Our robust method proves to be a promising alternative for the high-throughput quantification of lignin in milled biomass samples directly and simultaneously provides a direct insight into the structural features of lignin.;,citation_author=Gijs Erven;,citation_author=Ries Visser;,citation_author=Donny W.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A Systems Biology View of Responses to Lignin Biosynthesis Perturbations in Arabidopsis;,citation_abstract=Lignin engineering is an attractive strategy to improve lignocellulosic biomass quality for processing to biofuels and other bio-based products. However, lignin engineering also results in profound metabolic consequences in the plant. We used a systems biology approach to study the plant’s response to lignin perturbations. To this end, inflorescence stems of 20 Arabidopsis thaliana mutants, each mutated in a single gene of the lignin biosynthetic pathway (phenylalanine ammonia-lyase1 [PAL1], PAL2, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase [C4H], 4-coumarate:CoA ligase1 [4CL1], 4CL2, caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase1 [CCoAOMT1], cinnamoyl-CoA reductase1 [CCR1], ferulate 5-hydroxylase [F5H1], caffeic acid O-methyltransferase [COMT], and cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase6 [CAD6], two mutant alleles each), were analyzed by transcriptomics and metabolomics. A total of 566 compounds were detected, of which 187 could be tentatively identified based on mass spectrometry fragmentation and many were new for Arabidopsis. Up to 675 genes were differentially expressed in mutants that did not have any obvious visible phenotypes. Comparing the responses of all mutants indicated that c4h, 4cl1, ccoaomt1, and ccr1, mutants that produced less lignin, upregulated the shikimate, methyl-donor, and phenylpropanoid pathways (i.e., the pathways supplying the monolignols). By contrast, f5h1 and comt, mutants that provoked lignin compositional shifts, downregulated the very same pathways. Reductions in the flux to lignin were associated with the accumulation of various classes of 4-O- and 9-O-hexosylated phenylpropanoids. By combining metabolomic and transcriptomic data in a correlation network, system-wide consequences of the perturbations were revealed and genes with a putative role in phenolic metabolism were identified. Together, our data provide insight into lignin biosynthesis and the metabolic network it is embedded in and provide a systems view of the plant’s response to pathway perturbations.;,citation_author=R.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Metabolic engineering of novel lignin in biomass crops;,citation_abstract=Lignin, a phenolic polymer in the secondary wall, is the major cause of lignocellulosic biomass recalcitrance to efficient industrial processing. From an applications perspective, it is desirable that second-generation bioenergy crops have lignin that is readily degraded by chemical pretreatments but still fulfill its biological role in plants. Because plants can tolerate large variations in lignin composition, often without apparent adverse effects, substitution of some fraction of the traditional monolignols by alternative monomers through genetic engineering is a promising strategy to tailor lignin in bioenergy crops. However, successful engineering of lignin incorporating alternative monomers requires knowledge about phenolic metabolism in plants and about the coupling properties of these alternative monomers. Here, we review the current knowledge about lignin biosynthesis and the pathways towards the main phenolic classes. In addition, the minimal requirements are defined for molecules that, upon incorporation into the lignin polymer, make the latter more susceptible to biomass pretreatment. Numerous metabolites made by plants meet these requirements, and several have already been tested as monolignol substitutes in biomimetic systems. Finally, the status of detection and identification of compounds by phenolic profiling is discussed, as phenolic profiling serves in pathway elucidation and for the detection of incorporation of alternative lignin monomers.;,citation_author=Ruben Vanholme;,citation_author=Kris Morreel;,citation_author=Chiarina Darrah;,citation_author=Paula Oyarce;,citation_author=John H.

The lignin composition of P. nigra trees homozygous for the defective allele was compared with that of heterozygous trees and trees without the defective allele. The lignin was characterized by phenolic profiling, lignin oligomer sequencing, thioacidolysis and NMR. In addition, HCT1 was heterologously expressed for activity assays and crosses were made to introduce the mutation in different genetic backgrounds. HCT1 converts p-coumaroyl-CoA into p-coumaroyl shikimate. The mutant allele, PnHCT1-\Delta73, encodes a truncated protein, and trees homozygous for this recessive allele have a modified lignin composition characterized by a 17-fold increase in p-hydroxyphenyl units. Using the lignin pathway as proof of concept, we illustrated that the capture of rare defective alleles is a straightforward approach to initiate reverse genetics and accelerate tree breeding. The proposed breeding strategy, called ’breeding with rare defective alleles’ (BRDA), should be widely applicable, independent of the target gene or the species.;,citation_author=Bartel Vanholme;,citation_author=Igor Cesarino;,citation_author=Geert Goeminne;,citation_author=Hoon Kim;,citation_author=Fabio Marroni;,citation_author=Rebecca Van Acker;,citation_author=Ruben Vanholme;,citation_author=Kris Morreel;,citation_author=Bart Ivens;,citation_author=Sara Pinosio;,citation_author=Michele Morgante;,citation_author=John Ralph;,citation_author=Catherine Bastien;,citation_author=Wout Boerjan;,citation_publication_date=2013;,citation_cover_date=2013;,citation_year=2013;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1111/nph.12179;,citation_isbn=1469-8137 (Electronic){\textbackslash}r0028-646X (Linking);,citation_issn=0028646X;,citation_pmid=23432219;,citation_volume=198;,citation_journal_title=New Phytol.;">

The corresponding enzyme catalyzes the polymerization of GlcNAc and, accordingly, \beta-1,4-GlcNAc oligomers accumulated in the plant. A phenotype characterized by difficulties in developing an inflorescence stem was visible when plants were grown for several weeks under short-day conditions before transfer to long-day conditions. In addition, a positive correlation between the oligomer concentration and the penetrance of the phenotype was demonstrated. Although NodC overexpression lines produced less cell wall compared with wild-type plants under nonpermissive conditions, no indications were found for changes in the amount of the major cell wall polymers. The effect on the cell wall was reflected at the transcriptome level. In addition to genes encoding cell wall-modifying enzymes, a whole set of genes encoding membrane-coupled receptor-like kinases were differentially expressed upon GlcNAc accumulation, many of which encoded proteins with an extracellular Domain of Unknown Function26. Although stress-related genes were also differentially expressed, the observed response differed from that of a classical chitin response. This is in line with the fact that the produced chitin oligomers were too small to activate the chitin receptor-mediated signal cascade. Based on our observations, we propose a model in which the oligosaccharides modify the architecture of the cell wall by acting as competitors in carbohydrate-carbohydrate or carbohydrate-protein interactions, thereby affecting noncovalent interactions in the cell wall or at the interface between the cell wall and the plasma membrane.;,citation_author=B.

To fill this gap, we combined a systematic phosphoproteomics screen with a targeted protein complex analysis in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Integration of the phosphoproteome and protein complex data on the one hand shows that both methods reveal complementary subspaces of the plant TOR signalling network, enabling proteome-wide discovery of both upstream and downstream network components. On the other hand, the overlap between both data sets reveals a set of candidate direct TOR substrates. The integrated network embeds both evolutionarily-conserved and plant-specific TOR signalling components, uncovering an intriguing complex interplay with protein synthesis. Overall, the network provides a rich data set to start addressing fundamental questions about how TOR controls key processes in plants, such as autophagy, auxin signalling, chloroplast development, lipid metabolism, nucleotide biosynthesis, protein translation or senescence.;,citation_author=Jelle Van Leene;,citation_author=Chao Han;,citation_author=Astrid Gadeyne;,citation_author=Dominique Eeckhout;,citation_author=Caroline Matthijs;,citation_author=Bernard Cannoot;,citation_author=Nancy De Winne;,citation_author=Geert Persiau;,citation_author=Eveline Van De Slijke;,citation_author=Brigitte Van de Cotte;,citation_author=Elisabeth Stes;,citation_author=Michiel Van Bel;,citation_author=Veronique Storme;,citation_author=Francis Impens;,citation_author=Kris Gevaert;,citation_author=Klaas Vandepoele;,citation_author=Ive De Smet;,citation_author=Geert De Jaeger;,citation_publication_date=2019-03;,citation_cover_date=2019-03;,citation_year=2019;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1038/s41477-019-0378-z;,citation_issn=2055-0278;,citation_volume=5;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Nat.

Here, we report the identification and characterization of four cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenases (CADs) from cucumber (Cucumis sativus) with low activity toward p-coumaraldehyde yet exhibiting significant activity toward other phenylpropanoid hydroxycinnamaldehydes. As part of this analysis, we identified and characterized the activity of a hydroxycinnamoyl-coenzyme A:shikimate hydroxycinnamoyl transferase (HCT) capable of utilizing shikimate and p-coumaroyl-coenzyme A to generate p-coumaroyl shikimate. Following pectinase treatment of cucumber, we observed the rapid accumulation of p-coumaraldehyde, likely the result of low aldehyde reductase activity (i.e. alcohol dehydrogenase in the reverse reaction) of CsCAD enzymes on p-coumaraldehyde. In parallel, we noted a concomitant reduction in the activity of CsHCT. Taken together, our findings support the hypothesis that the up-regulation of the phenylpropanoid pathway upon abiotic stress greatly enhances the overall p-coumaryl alcohol branch of the pathway. The data presented here point to a role for CsHCT (as well as, presumably, p-coumarate 3-hydroxylase) as a control point in the regulation of the coniferyl and sinapyl alcohol branches of this pathway. This mechanism represents a potentially evolutionarily conserved process to efficiently and quickly respond to biotic and abiotic stresses in cucurbit plants, resulting in the rapid lignification of affected tissues.;,citation_author=Marina Varbanova;,citation_author=Katie Porter;,citation_author=Fachuang Lu;,citation_author=John Ralph;,citation_author=Ray Hammerschmidt;,citation_author=A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A MYB/ZML Complex Regulates Wound-Induced Lignin Genes in Maize;,citation_abstract=Lignin is an essential polymer in vascular plants that plays key structural roles in vessels and fibers. Lignification is induced by external inputs such as wounding, but the molecular mechanisms that link this stress to lignification remain largely unknown. In this work, we provide evidence that three maize (Zea mays) lignin repressors, MYB11, MYB31, and MYB42, participate in wound-induced lignification by interacting with ZML2, a protein belonging to the TIFY family. We determined that the three R2R3-MYB factors and ZML2 bind in vivo to AC-rich and GAT(A/C) cis-elements, respectively, present in a set of lignin genes. In particular, we show that MYB11 and ZML2 bind simultaneously to the AC-rich and GAT(A/C) cis-elements present in the promoter of the caffeic acid O-methyl transferase (comt) gene. We show that, like the R2R3-MYB factors, ZML2 also acts as a transcriptional repressor. We found that upon wounding and methyl jasmonate treatments, MYB11 and ZML2 proteins are degraded and comt transcription is induced.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Hypoxia induces H2O2 production and activates antioxidant defence system in grapevine buds through mediation of H2O2 and ethylene;,citation_abstract=Paradoxically, in eukaryotic cells, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) accumulates in response to oxygen deprivation (hypoxia). The source of H2O2 under hypoxia varies according to the species, organs, and tissue. In non-photosynthetic tissues, H2O2 is mainly produced by activation of NAD(P)H-oxidases or by disruption of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (m-ETC). This study showed that hypoxia, and inhibitors of respiration like potassium cyanide (KCN) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP), trigger the production of H2O2 in grapevine buds. However, diphenyleneiodonium, an inhibitor of NAD(P)H-oxidase, did not reduce the H2O2 levels induced by KCN, suggesting that, under respiratory stress, H2O2 is mainly produced by disruption of the m-ETC. On the other hand, \gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a metabolite that in plants alleviates oxidative stress by activating antioxidant enzymes, reduced significantly the levels of H2O2 induced by KCN and, surprisingly, repressed the expression of genes encoding antioxidant enzymes such as ASCORBATE PEROXIDASE (VvAPX), GLUTATHIONE PEROXIDASE (VvGLPX), SUPEROXIDE DISMUTASE (VvSOD), and one of the CATALASE isoforms (VvCAT1), while VvCAT2 was upregulated. In contrast to GABA, hypoxia, H2O2, and ethylene increased dramatically the expression of genes encoding antioxidant enzymes and enzymes of the alternative respiratory pathway such as ALTERNATIVE NADH-DEHYDROGENASES (VvaNDs) and ALTERNATIVE OXIDASES (VvAOXs). Hence, it is concluded that H2O2 production is stimulated by respiratory stress in grapevine buds, that H2O2 and ethylene act as signalling molecules and activate genes related to the antioxidant defence system, and finally that GABA reduces H2O2 levels by up-regulating the expression of VvCAT2.;,citation_author=Ricardo Vergara;,citation_author=Francisca Parada;,citation_author=Sebastián Rubio;,citation_author=Francisco J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Passive membrane transport of lignin-related compounds;,citation_abstract=Lignin is an abundant aromatic polymer found in plant secondary cell walls. In recent years, lignin has attracted renewed interest as a feedstock for bio-based chemicals via catalytic and biological approaches and has emerged as a target for genetic engineering to improve lignocellulose digestibility by altering its composition. In lignin biosynthesis and microbial conversion, small phenolic lignin precursors or degradation products cross membrane bilayers through an unidentified translocation mechanism prior to incorporation into lignin polymers (synthesis) or catabolism (bioconversion), with both passive and transporter-assisted mechanisms postulated. To test the passive permeation potential of these phenolics, we performed molecular dynamics simulations for 69 monomeric and dimeric lignin-related phenolics with 3 model membranes to determine the membrane partitioning and permeability coefficients for each compound. The results support an accessible passive permeation mechanism for most compounds, including monolignols, dimeric phenolics, and the flavonoid, tricin. Computed lignin partition coefficients are consistent with concentration enrichment near lipid carbonyl groups, and permeability coefficients are sufficient to keep pace with cellular metabolism. Interactions between methoxy and hydroxy groups are found to reduce membrane partitioning and improve permeability. Only carboxylate-modified or glycosylated lignin phenolics are predicted to require transporters for membrane translocation. Overall, the results suggest that most lignin-related compounds can passively traverse plant and microbial membranes on timescales commensurate with required biological activities, with any potential transport regulation mechanism in lignin synthesis, catabolism, or bioconversion requiring compound functionalization.;,citation_author=Josh V.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The brown Midrib3 (Bm3) Mutation in Maize Occurs in the Gene Encoding Caffeic Acid O-Methyltransferase;,citation_abstract=The brown midrib mutations are among the earliest described in maize. Plants containing a brown midrib mutation exhibit a reddish brown pigmentation of the leaf midrib starting when there are four to six leaves. These mutations are known to alter lignin composition and digestibility of plants and therefore constitute prime candidates in the breeding of silage maize. Here, we show that two independent brown midrib3 (bm3) mutations have resulted from structural changes in the COMT gene, which encodes the enzyme O-methyltransferase (COMT; EC 2.1.1.6), involved in lignin biosynthesis. Our results indicate that the bm3-1 allele (the reference mutant allele) has arisen from an insertional event producing a COMT mRNA altered in both size and amount. By sequencing a COMT cDNA clone obtained from bm3-1 maize, a retrotransposon with homology to the B5 element has been found to be inserted near the junction of the 3’ coding region of the COMT gene intron. The second bm3 allele, bm3-2, has resulted from a deletion of part of the COMT gene. These alterations of the COMT gene were confirmed by DNA gel blot and polymerase chain reaction amplification analyses. These results clearly demonstrate that mutations at the COMT gene give a brown midrib3 phenotype. Thus, the gene genetically recognized as bm3 is the same as the one coding for COMT.;,citation_author=F.

However, most methods currently available are either destructive, are not compatible with hosting a physiological environment, or introduces exogenous probes, complicating their use for studying changes in microstructure and mechanisms of plant development, recalcitrance, or degradation in situ. To address these challenges, we here present a multi-modal chemically specific imaging technique based on coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microspectroscopy with simplex maximization and entropy-based spectral unmixing enabling label-free, chemically specific characterization of plant microstructure in liquid. We describe how spatial drift of samples suspended in liquid can introduce artifacts in spectral unmixing procedures for single-frequency CARS and propose a mitigative strategy toward these effects using simultaneously acquired forward-scattered CARS signals and epi-detected autofluorescence. We further apply the technique for chemical and microstructural characterization of untreated and liquid hot water pretreated rapeseed straw by CARS and show how the framework can be extended for 3D imaging with chemical specificity.

Transgenic events had different levels of down-regulation of two genes encoding 4-coumarate:coenzyme A ligase (4CL). Two-year-old trees were characterized after growing either as free-standing trees in the field or as supported by stakes in a greenhouse. In free-standing trees, a 20 to 40% reduction in lignin content was associated with increased xylem vulnerability to embolism, shoot dieback and mortality. In staked trees, the decreased biomechanical demands on the xylem was associated with increases in the leaf area to sapwood area ratio and wood specific conductivity (ks), and with decreased leaf-specific conductivity (kl). These shifts in hydraulic architecture suggest that the bending stresses perceived during growth can affect traits important for xylem water transport. Severe 4CL-downregulation resulted in the patchy formation of discoloured, brown wood with irregular vessels in which water transport was strongly impeded. These severely 4CL-downregulated trees had significantly lower growth efficiency (biomass/leaf area).

During the last decade, methodology driven targeted and non-targeted approaches in several plant species have enabled the identification of the participating enzymes of this complex biosynthetic machinery, and revealed numerous genes, enzymes, and metabolites essential for regulation and compartmentation. Considerable success in structural and computational biology, combined with the analytical sensitivity to detect even trace compounds and smallest changes in the metabolite, transcript, or enzyme pattern, has facilitated progress towards a comprehensive view of the plant response to its biotic and abiotic environment.

For the production of bioethanol, both stem biomass yield and the conversion efficiency of the polysaccharides in the cell wall to fermentable sugars are of relevance. Increasing the endogenous levels of gibberellic acid (GA) by ectopic expression of GA20-OXIDASE1 (GA20-OX1), the rate-limiting step in GA biosynthesis, is known to affect cell division and cell expansion, resulting in larger plants and organs in several plant species. In this study, we examined biomass yield and quality traits of maize plants overexpressing GA20-OX1 (GA20-OX1). GA20-OX1 plants accumulated more vegetative biomass than control plants in greenhouse experiments, but not consistently over two years of field trials. The stems of these plants were longer but also more slender. Investigation of GA20-OX1 biomass quality using biochemical analyses showed the presence of more cellulose, lignin and cell wall residue. Cell wall analysis as well as expression analysis of lignin biosynthetic genes in developing stems revealed that cellulose and lignin were deposited earlier in development. Pretreatment of GA20-OX1 biomass with NaOH resulted in a higher saccharification efficiency per unit of dry weight, in agreement with the higher cellulose content. On the other hand, the cellulose-to-glucose conversion was slower upon HCl or hot-water pretreatment, presumably due to the higher lignin content.

Lignification is often described as a cell autonomous event occurring progressively in all cell wall layers during lignifying cell life and stopping with the cell death.

We have recently reported an extracellular activation of ENaC-mediated sodium transport (I(Na)) by a GPI-anchored serine protease (mouse channel-activating protein, mCAP1) that was isolated from a cortical collecting duct cell line derived from mouse kidney. In the present study, we have identified two additional membrane-bound serine proteases (mCAP2 and mCAP3) that are expressed in the same cell line. We show that each of these proteases is able to increase I(Na) 6-10-fold in the Xenopus oocyte expression system. I(Na) and the number (N) of channels expressed at the cell surface (measured by binding of a FLAG monoclonal I(125)-radioiodinated antibody) were measured in the same oocyte. Using this assay, we show that mCAP1 increases I(Na) 10-fold (P &amp;amp;amp;lt; 0.001) but N remained unchanged (P = 0.9), indicating that mCAP1 regulates ENaC activity by increasing its average open probability of the whole cell (wcP(o)).

Compared with Sgk1 alone, coexpression of Sgk1 with mCAP1 leads to a ninefold increase in I(Na) (P < 0.001) and 1.3-fold in N (P < 0.02). Similar results were observed for mCAP2 and mCAP3.

In this study, we performed functional and expression analyses of the Arabidopsis LAP2 through cDNA cloning, isolation of T-DNA insertional mutants, characterization of the enzymatic activity, characterization of gene expression and transcriptomics and metabolomics analyses of the mutants. Loss of function of LAP2, one of the 28 aminopeptidases in Arabidopsis, reduced vegetative growth, accelerated leaf senescence and rendered plants more sensitive to various stresses. LAP2 is highly expressed in the leaf vascular tissue and the quiescent center region. Integration of global gene expression and metabolite analyses suggest that LAP2 controlled intracellular amino acid turnover. The mutant maintained free leucine by up-regulating key genes for leucine biosynthesis. However, this influenced the flux of glutamate strikingly. As a result, \gamma-aminobutyric acid, a metabolite that is derived from glutamate, was diminished in the mutant. Decrements in these nitrogen-rich compounds are associated with morphological alterations and stress sensitivity of the mutant.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Syringyl lignin production in conifers: Proof of concept in a Pine tracheary element system;,citation_abstract=Conifers (softwoods) naturally lack syringyl units in their lignins, rendering lignocellulosic materials from such species more difficult to process than syringyl-rich hardwood species. Using a transformable Pinus radiata tracheary element (TE) system as an experimental platform, we investigated whether metabolic engineering can be used to create syringyl lignin in conifers. Pyrolysis-GC/MS and 2D-NMR analysis of P. radiata TE cultures transformed to express ferulate 5-hydroxylase (F5H) and caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (COMT) from Liquidambar styraciflua confirmed the production and incorporation of sinapyl alcohol into the lignin polymer. Transformation with F5H was sufficient for the production of syringyl lignin in TEs, but cotransformation with COMT improved its formation. In addition, lower levels of the pathway intermediate 5-hydroxyconiferyl alcohol were evidenced in cotransformation experiments, indicating that the introduction of the COMT overcame the inefficiency of the native pine methyltransferases for supporting sinapyl alcohol production.Our results provide the proof of concept that it is possible to generate a lignin polymer that contains syringyl units in softwood species such as P. radiata, suggesting that it might be possible to retain the outstanding fiber properties of softwoods while imbuing them with the lignin characteristics of hardwoods that are more favorable for industrial processing.;,citation_author=Armin Wagner;,citation_author=Yuki Tobimatsu;,citation_author=Lorelle Phillips;,citation_author=Heather Flint;,citation_author=Barbara Geddes;,citation_author=Fachuang Lu;,citation_author=John Ralph;,citation_publication_date=2015;,citation_cover_date=2015;,citation_year=2015;,citation_issue=19;,citation_doi=10.1073/pnas.1411926112;,citation_isbn=0261-4189 (Print){\textbackslash}n0261-4189 (Linking);,citation_issn=0027-8424;,citation_pmid=25902506;,citation_volume=112;,citation_journal_title=Proc.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Recycling or regulation? The role of amino-terminal modifying enzymes;,citation_abstract=Post-translational modifications are essential for a variety of functions, such as the translocation, activation, regulation, and, ultimately, degradation of proteins. The amino-terminal (N-terminal) region is a particularly active area for such alterations. Three types of reactions predominate: limited proteolysis to remove one or more amino acids; modification of the ??-amino group; and side-chain-specific changes. The N-terminal peptidases expose penultimate residues, providing new substrates for peptidase or transferase action. These enzymes can act sequentially or competitively to influence a protein’s longevity, location or activity. N-terminal modifying enzymes (NTMEs) might target a protein for ubiquitination and degradation or protect a protein from rapid turnover. The N-terminal peptidases might also have important roles in processing the peptides that are released from the proteasome. Plant NTMEs have roles in senescence, meiosis and defense, and proposed roles in polar auxin transport. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;,citation_author=Linda L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Development and testing of a general amber force field;,citation_abstract=We describe here a general Amber force field (GAFF) for organic molecules. GAFF is designed to be compatible with existing Amber force fields for proteins and nucleic acids, and has parameters for most organic and pharmaceutical molecules that are composed of H, C, N, O, S, P, and halogens. It uses a simple functional form and a limited number of atom types, but incorporates both empirical and heuristic models to estimate force constants and partial atomic charges. The performance of GAFF in test cases is encouraging. In test I, 74 crystallographic structures were compared to GAFF minimized structures, with a root-mean-square displacement of 0.26 Å, which is comparable to that of the Tripos 5.2 force field (0.25 Å) and better than those of MMFF 94 and CHARMm (0.47 and 0.44 Å, respectively). In test II, gas phase minimizations were performed on 22 nucleic acid base pairs, and the minimized structures and intermolecular energies were compared to MP2/6-31G* results. The RMS of displacements and relative energies were 0.25 Å and 1.2 kcal/mol, respectively. These data are comparable to results from Parm99/RESP (0.16 Å and 1.18 kcal/mol, respectively), which were parameterized to these base pairs. Test III looked at the relative energies of 71 conformational pairs that were used in development of the Parm99 force field. The RMS error in relative energies (compared to experiment) is about 0.5 kcal/mol.

The biosynthesis of syringyl subunits is initiated by coniferaldehyde 5-hydroxylase (CAld5H). In Populus trichocarpa there are two closely related CAld5H enzymes (PtrCAld5H1 and PtrCAld5H2) associated with lignin biosynthesis during wood formation. We used yeast recombinant PtrCAld5H1 and PtrCAld5H2 proteins to carry out Michaelis-Menten and inhibition kinetics with LC-MS/MS based absolute protein quantification. CAld5H, a monooxygenase, requires a cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) as an electron donor. We cloned and expressed three P. trichocarpa CPRs in yeast and show that all are active with both CAld5Hs. The kinetic analysis shows both CAld5Hs have essentially the same biochemical functions. When both CAld5Hs are coexpressed in the same yeast membranes, the resulting enzyme activities are additive, suggesting functional redundancy and independence of these two enzymes. Simulated reaction flux based on Michaelis-Menten kinetics and inhibition kinetics confirmed the redundancy and independence. Subcellular localization of both CAld5Hs as sGFP fusion proteins expressed in P. trichocarpa differentiating xylem protoplasts indicate that they are endoplasmic reticulum resident proteins. These results imply that during wood formation, 5-hydroxylation in monolignol biosynthesis of P. trichocarpa requires the combined metabolic flux of these two CAld5Hs to maintain adequate biosynthesis of syringyl lignin. The combination of genetic analysis, absolute protein quantitation-based enzyme kinetics, homologous CPR specificity, SNP characterization, and ER localization provides a more rigorous basis for a comprehensive systems understanding of 5-hydroxylation in lignin biosynthesis.;,citation_author=Jack P.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Plant cell wall lignification and monolignol metabolism;,citation_abstract=Plants are built of various specialized cell types that differ in their cell wall composition and structure. The cell walls of certain tissues (xylem, sclerenchyma) are characterized by the presence of the heterogeneous lignin polymer that plays an essential role in their physiology. This phenolic polymer is composed of different monomeric units - the monolignols - that are linked together by several covalent bonds. Numerous studies have shown that monolignol biosynthesis and polymerization to form lignin are tightly controlled in different cell types and tissues. However, our understanding of the genetic control of monolignol transport and polymerization remains incomplete, despite some recent promising results. This situation is made more complex since we know that monolignols or related compounds are sometimes produced in non-lignified tissues. In this review, we focus on some key steps of monolignol metabolism including polymerization, transport, and compartmentation. As well as being of fundamental interest, the quantity of lignin and its nature are also known to have a negative effect on the industrial processing of plant lignocellulose biomass.

Here, we show that a laccase gene, LAC4, regulated by a microRNA, miR397b, controls both lignin biosynthesis and seed yield in Arabidopsis. In transgenic plants, overexpression of miR397b (OXmiR397b) reduced lignin deposition. The secondary wall thickness of vessels and the fibres was reduced in the OXmiR397b line, and both syringyl and guaiacyl subunits are decreased, leading to weakening of vascular tissues. In contrast, overexpression of miR397b-resistant laccase mRNA results in an opposite phenotype. Plants overexpressing miR397b develop more than two inflorescence shoots and have an increased silique number and silique length, resulting in higher seed numbers. In addition, enlarged seeds and more seeds are formed in these miR397b overexpression plants.

PRXs are plant-specific enzymes that play important roles in cell wall metabolism and in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. We found that two large tandem-arrayed clusters of PRXs evolved from an ancestral cell wall type PRX to vacuole type, followed by tandem duplications and subsequent functional specification. Substitution models identified seven positively selected sites in the vacuole PRXs. These positively selected sites showed significant effects on the biochemical functions of the enzymes. We also found that positive selection acts more frequently on residues adjacent to, rather than directly at, a critical active site of the enzyme, and on flexible regions rather than on rigid structural elements of the protein.

We performed systematic bioinformatics analysis of the PRX genes, including analysis of gene structures, conserved motifs, phylogenetic relationships and gene expression profiles. The ZmPRXs are unevenly distributed on the 10 maize chromosomes. In addition, these genes have undergone 16 segmental duplication and 12 tandem duplication events, indicating that both segmental and tandem duplication were the main contributors to the expansion of the maize PRX family. Ka/Ks analysis suggested that most duplicated ZmPRXs experienced purifying selection, with limited functional divergence during the duplication events, and comparative analysis among maize, sorghum and rice revealed that there were independent duplication events besides the whole-genome duplication of the maize genome.

In dicots, both peroxidases and laccases are known to participate in this process. Here, we provide evidence that laccases are also involved in the lignification of Brachypodium distachyon, a model plant for temperate grasses. Transcript quantification data as well as in situ and immunolocalization experiments demonstrated that at least two laccases (LACCASE5 and LACCASE6) are present in lignifying tissues. A mutant with a misspliced LACCASE5 messenger RNA was identified in a targeting-induced local lesion in genome mutant collection. This mutant shows 10% decreased Klason lignin content and modification of the syringyl-to-guaiacyl units ratio. The amount of ferulic acid units ester linked to the mutant cell walls is increased by 40% when compared with control plants, while the amount of ferulic acid units ether linked to lignins is decreased. In addition, the mutant shows a higher saccharification efficiency. These results provide clear evidence that laccases are required for B. distachyon lignification and are promising targets to alleviate the recalcitrance of grass lignocelluloses.;,citation_author=Yin Wang;,citation_author=Oumaya Bouchabke-Coussa;,citation_author=Philippe Lebris;,citation_author=Sébastien Antelme;,citation_author=Camille Soulhat;,citation_author=Emilie Gineau;,citation_author=Marion Dalmais;,citation_author=Abdelafid Bendahmane;,citation_author=Halima Morin;,citation_author=Grégory Mouille;,citation_author=Frédéric Legée;,citation_author=Laurent Cézard;,citation_author=Catherine Lapierre;,citation_author=Richard Sibout;,citation_publication_date=2015;,citation_cover_date=2015;,citation_year=2015;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1104/pp.114.255489;,citation_isbn=0032-0889;,citation_issn=0032-0889;,citation_pmid=25755252;,citation_volume=168;,citation_journal_title=Plant Physiol.;">

Until now, no systematic identification of lncRNAs has been reported in cotton (Gossypium spp.). Here, we describe the identification of 30 550 long intergenic noncoding RNA (lincRNA) loci (50 566 transcripts) and 4718 long noncoding natural antisense transcript (lncNAT) loci (5826 transcripts). LncRNAs are rich in repetitive sequences and preferentially expressed in a tissue-specific manner. The detection of abundant genome-specific and/or lineage-specific lncRNAs indicated their weak evolutionary conservation. Approximately 76{%} of homoeologous lncRNAs exhibit biased expression patterns towards the At or Dt subgenomes. Compared with protein-coding genes, lncRNAs showed overall higher methylation levels and their expression was less affected by gene body methylation. Expression validation in different cotton accessions and coexpression network construction helped to identify several functional lncRNA candidates involved in cotton fibre initiation and elongation.

To understand the linkage between traditional macro-elemental and morphological traits of roots and their molecular-level carbon chemistry, we analyzed seasonal variations in monomeric yields of the free, bound, and lignin phenols in fine roots (distal five orders) and leaves of Ardisia quinquegona. Fine roots contained two-fold higher concentrations of bound phenols and three-fold higher concentrations of lignin phenols than leaves. Within fine roots, the concentrations of free and bound phenols decreased with increasing root order, and seasonal variation in the phenolic profile was more evident in lower order than in higher order roots. The morphological and macro-elemental root traits were decoupled from the quantity, composition and tissue association of phenolic compounds, revealing the potential inability of these traditional parameters to capture the molecular identity of phenolic carbon within the fine-root architecture and between fine roots and leaves. Our results highlight the molecular-level heterogeneity in phenolic carbon composition within the fine-root architecture, and imply that traits that capture the molecular identity of the root construct might better predict the decomposition dynamics within fine-root orders.;,citation_author=Jun Jian Wang;,citation_author=Nishanth Tharayil;,citation_author=Alex T.

The maize NLR protein Rp1-D21 derives from an intragenic recombination between two NLRs, Rp1-D and Rp1-dp2, and confers an autoactive HR in the absence of pathogen infection. From a previous QTL and genome wide association study, we identified a SNP locus highly associated with variation in the severity of Rp1-D21-induced HR. Two maize genes encoding hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (HCT, a key enzyme involved in lignin biosynthesis) homologs, termed HCT1806 and HCT4918, were adjacent to this SNP. Here we show that both HCT1806 and HCT4918 physically interact with and suppress the HR conferred by Rp1-D21 but not by other autoactive NLRs when transiently co-expressed in N. benthamiana.

The metabolic activity of HCT1806 and HCT4918 is unlikely to be necessary for their role in suppressing HR.

It is widely distributed in bacteria, fungi, plants and insects. Laccases are encoded by multigene family, and have been characterized mostly from fungi till now, with abundant industrial applications in pulp and paper, textile, food industries, organic synthesis, bioremediation and nanobiotechnology, while limited researches have been performed in plants, and no application has been reported. Plant laccases share the common molecular architecture and reaction mechanism with fungal ones, despite of difference in redox potential and pH optima. Plant laccases are implicated in lignin biosynthesis since genetic evidence was derived from the Arabidopsis LAC4 and LAC17. Manipulation of plant laccases has been considered as a promising and innovative strategy in plant biomass engineering for desirable lignin content and/or composition, since lignin is the major recalcitrant component to saccharification in biofuel production from lignocellulose, and therefore directly limits the fermentation yields. Moreover, plant laccases have been reported to be involved in wound healing, maintenance of cell wall structure and integrity, and plant responses to environmental stresses.

Here, we present the discovery of phosphorylation-mediated on/off regulation of enzyme activity for 5-hydroxyconiferaldehyde O-methyltransferase 2 (PtrAldOMT2), an enzyme central to monolignol biosynthesis for lignification in stem-differentiating xylem (SDX) of Populus trichocarpa. Phosphorylation turned off the PtrAldOMT2 activity, as demonstrated in vitro by using purified phosphorylated and unphosphorylated recombinant PtrAldOMT2. Protein extracts of P. trichocarpa SDX, which contains endogenous kinases, also phosphorylated recombinant PtrAldOMT2 and turned off the recombinant protein activity. Similarly, ATP/Mn(2+)-activated phosphorylation of SDX protein extracts reduced the endogenous SDX PtrAldOMT2 activity by \sim60%, and dephosphorylation fully restored the activity. Global shotgun proteomic analysis of phosphopeptide-enriched P. trichocarpa SDX protein fractions identified PtrAldOMT2 monophosphorylation at Ser(123) or Ser(125) in vivo. Phosphorylation-site mutagenesis verified the PtrAldOMT2 phosphorylation at Ser(123) or Ser(125) and confirmed the functional importance of these phosphorylation sites for O-methyltransferase activity. The PtrAldOMT2 Ser(123) phosphorylation site is conserved across 93% of AldOMTs from 46 diverse plant species, and 98% of the AldOMTs have either Ser(123) or Ser(125). PtrAldOMT2 is a homodimeric cytosolic enzyme expressed more abundantly in syringyl lignin-rich fiber cells than in guaiacyl lignin-rich vessel cells.

Proteomic analyses revealed that the proteins involved in light reaction of photosynthesis, amino acid and carbohydrate metabolisms, secondary metabolite biosynthesis and posttranslational modification showed increased levels in response to salt stress.

The activities of phenylpropanoid biosynthetic enzymes and the contents of phenols, flavonoids, anthocyanins and lignins were significantly increased under salt stress. In the free amino acid pool, glutamate was the most abundant.

The catalysis and transformation mechanism were investigated in detail. The kinetic parameters of the Amplex Red catalysis by laccase were determined using the Lineweaver???Burk equation. Vmax and Km were estimated to be 15.63????mol??min???1 and 76.88????mol??L???1, respectively.

A series of repeatability measurements (351??U??L???1 laccase) gave reproducible results with a relative standard deviation (RSD) of 1.9% (n=11). The recoveries ranged from 93.7% to 100.0% after standard additions.

Its properties make it a natural source of carbon fibers and high-value chemicals, but the mechanism of in planta polymerization of caffeyl alcohol remains unclear. In the ornamental plant Cleome hassleriana, lignin biosynthesis in the seed coat switches from guaiacyl lignin to C-lignin at \sim12 d after pollination. Here we found that the transcript profile of the laccase gene ChLAC8 parallels the accumulation of C-lignin during seed coat development. Recombinant ChLAC8 oxidizes caffeyl and sinapyl alcohols, generating their corresponding dimers or trimers in vitro, but cannot oxidize coniferyl alcohol. We propose a basis for this substrate preference based on molecular modeling/docking experiments. Suppression of ChLAC8 expression led to significantly reduced C-lignin content in the seed coats of transgenic Cleome plants. Feeding of 13C-caffeyl alcohol to the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) caffeic acid o-methyltransferase mutant resulted in no incorporation of 13C into C-lignin, but expressing ChLAC8 in this genetic background led to appearance of C-lignin with &amp;amp;gt;40% label incorporation.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Integrated omics reveal novel functions and underlying mechanisms of the receptor kinase FERONIA in Arabidopsis thaliana;,citation_abstract=The receptor kinase FERONIA (FER) is a versatile regulator of plant growth and development, biotic and abiotic stress responses, and reproduction. To gain new insights into the molecular interplay of these processes and to identify new FER functions, we carried out quantitative transcriptome, proteome, and phosphoproteome profiling of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) wild-type and fer-4 loss-of-function mutant plants. Gene ontology terms for phytohormone signaling, abiotic stress, and biotic stress were significantly enriched among differentially expressed transcripts, differentially abundant proteins, and/or misphosphorylated proteins, in agreement with the known roles for FER in these processes. Analysis of multiomics data and subsequent experimental evidence revealed previously unknown functions for FER in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) body formation and glucosinolate biosynthesis. FER functions through the transcription factor NAI1 to mediate ER body formation. FER also negatively regulates indole glucosinolate biosynthesis, partially through NAI1. Furthermore, we found that a group of abscisic acid (ABA)-induced transcription factors is hypophosphorylated in the fer-4 mutant and demonstrated that FER acts through the transcription factor ABA INSENSITIVE5 (ABI5) to negatively regulate the ABA response during cotyledon greening. Our integrated omics study, therefore, reveals novel functions for FER and provides new insights into the underlying mechanisms of FER function.;,citation_author=Ping Wang;,citation_author=Natalie M Clark;,citation_author=Trevor M Nolan;,citation_author=Gaoyuan Song;,citation_author=Parker M Bartz;,citation_author=Ching-Yi Liao;,citation_author=Christian Montes-Serey;,citation_author=Ella Katz;,citation_author=Joanna K Polko;,citation_author=Joseph J Kieber;,citation_author=Daniel J Kliebenstein;,citation_author=Diane C Bassham;,citation_author=Justin W Walley;,citation_author=Yanhai Yin;,citation_author=Hongqing Guo;,citation_publication_date=2022-07;,citation_cover_date=2022-07;,citation_year=2022;,citation_issue=7;,citation_doi=10.1093/plcell/koac111;,citation_issn=1040-4651;,citation_volume=34;,citation_journal_title=Plant Cell;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=ENB1 encodes a cellulose synthase 5 that directs synthesis of cell wall ingrowths in maize basal endosperm transfer cells;,citation_abstract=Development of the endosperm is strikingly different in monocots and dicots: it often manifests as a persistent tissue in the former and transient tissue in the latter. Little is known about the controlling mechanisms responsible for these different outcomes. Here we characterized a maize (Zea mays) mutant, endosperm breakdown1 (enb1), in which the typically persistent endosperm (PE) was drastically degraded during kernel development. ENB1 encodes a cellulose synthase 5 that is predominantly expressed in the basal endosperm transfer layer (BETL) of endosperm cells. Loss of ENB1 function caused a drastic reduction in formation of flange cell wall ingrowths (ingrowths) in BETL cells. Defective ingrowths impair nutrient uptake, leading to premature utilization of endosperm starch to nourish the embryo. Similarly, developing wild-type kernels cultured in vitro with a low level of sucrose manifested early endosperm breakdown. ENB1 expression is induced by sucrose via the BETL-specific Myb-Related Protein1 transcription factor. Overexpression of ENB1 enhanced development of flange ingrowths, facilitating sucrose transport into BETL cells and increasing kernel weight. The results demonstrated that ENB1 enhances sucrose supply to the endosperm and contributes to a PE in the kernel.;,citation_author=Qun Wang;,citation_author=Mingmin Wang;,citation_author=Jian Chen;,citation_author=Weiwei Qi;,citation_author=Jinsheng Lai;,citation_author=Zeyang Ma;,citation_author=Rentao Song;,citation_publication_date=2022-03;,citation_cover_date=2022-03;,citation_year=2022;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1093/plcell/koab312;,citation_issn=1040-4651;,citation_volume=34;,citation_journal_title=Plant Cell;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Sucrose synthase activity is not required for cellulose biosynthesis in Arabidopsis;,citation_abstract=Biosynthesis of plant cell walls requires UDP-glucose as the substrate for cellulose biosynthesis, and as an intermediate for the synthesis of other matrix polysaccharides. The sucrose cleaving enzyme sucrose synthase (SUS) is thought to have a central role in UDP-glucose biosynthesis, and a long-held and much debated hypothesis postulates that SUS is required to supply UDP-glucose to cellulose biosynthesis. To investigate the role of SUS in cellulose biosynthesis of Arabidopsis thaliana we characterized mutants in which four or all six Arabidopsis SUS genes were disrupted. These sus mutants showed no growth phenotypes, vascular tissue cell wall defects, or changes in cellulose content. Moreover, the UDP-glucose content of rosette leaves of the sextuple sus mutants was increased by approximately 20% compared with wild type. It can thus be concluded that cellulose biosynthesis is able to employ alternative UDP-glucose biosynthesis pathway(s), and thereby the model of SUS requirements for cellulose biosynthesis in Arabidopsis can be refuted.;,citation_author=Wei Wang;,citation_author=Sonja Viljamaa;,citation_author=Ondrej Hodek;,citation_author=Thomas Moritz;,citation_author=Totte Niittylä;,citation_publication_date=2022;,citation_cover_date=2022;,citation_year=2022;,citation_issue=5;,citation_doi=10.1111/tpj.15752;,citation_issn=1365-313X;,citation_volume=110;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Plant J.;">

Here, we identify a xylan-rich nanodomain at pit borders of xylem vessels.

The nanocompartments are produced by the activity of IRREGULAR XYLEM (IRX)10 and its homologues, which we show are de novo xylan synthases.

The molecular mechanism and genetic regulation of ROL barrier formation are largely unknown. Zea nicaraguensis, a waterlogging-tolerant wild relative of maize (Zea mays ssp. mays), forms a tight ROL barrier in its roots when waterlogged. We used Z. nicaraguensis chromosome segment introgression lines (ILs) in maize (inbred line Mi29) to elucidate the chromosomal region involved in regulating root ROL barrier formation. A segment of the short-arm of chromosome 3 of Z. nicaraguensis conferred ROL barrier formation in the genetic background of maize. This chromosome segment also decreased apoplastic solute permeability across the hypodermis/exodermis. However, the IL and maize were similar for suberin staining in the hypodermis/exodermis at 40 mm and further behind the root tip. Z. nicaraguensis contained suberin in the hypodermis/exodermis at 20 mm and lignin at the epidermis. The IL with ROL barrier, however, did not contain lignin in the epidermis. Discovery of the Z. nicaraguensis chromosomal region responsible for root ROL barrier formation has improved knowledge of this trait and is an important step towards improvement of waterlogging tolerance in maize.;,citation_author=Kohtaro Watanabe;,citation_author=Hirokazu Takahashi;,citation_author=Saori Sato;,citation_author=Shunsaku Nishiuchi;,citation_author=Fumie Omori;,citation_author=Al Imran Malik;,citation_author=Timothy David Colmer;,citation_author=Yoshiro Mano;,citation_author=Mikio Nakazono;,citation_publication_date=2017;,citation_cover_date=2017;,citation_year=2017;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1111/pce.12849;,citation_issn=13653040;,citation_volume=40;,citation_journal_title=Plant Cell Environ.;">

Large differential increases in oxylipin-pathway lipoxygenases and auxin-responsive transcript levels in border cells corresponded to differences in phytohormone and volatile levels compared with adjacent root tips. Morphological examinations of border cells revealed the presence of significant starch deposits that serve as critical energy and carbon reserves, as documented through increased \beta-amylase transcript levels and associated starch hydrolysis metabolites. A substantial proportion of primary metabolism transcripts were decreased in border cells, while many flavonoid- and triterpenoid-related metabolite and transcript levels were increased dramatically. The cumulative data provide compounding evidence that primary and secondary metabolism are differentially programmed in border cells relative to root tips. Metabolic resources normally destined for growth and development are redirected toward elevated accumulation of specialized metabolites in border cells, resulting in constitutively elevated defense and signaling compounds needed to protect the delicate root cap and signal motile rhizobia required for symbiotic nitrogen fixation. Elevated levels of 7,4’-dihydroxyflavone were further increased in border cells of roots exposed to cotton root rot (Phymatotrichopsis omnivora), and the value of 7,4’-dihydroxyflavone as an antimicrobial compound was demonstrated using in vitro growth inhibition assays.

A large NMR database has been constructed that reports the (1)H and (13)C chemical shifts for thousands of lignin oligomers. Herein, Boltzmann averaged (1)H and (13)C GIAO NMR calculations were performed on coniferyl alcohol and four of its dimers, \beta-O-4, \beta-\beta, \beta-5, and 5-5, to compare the calculated chemical shifts with experiment. Six B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) energy-minimized conformational isomers of coniferyl alcohol were subjected to single-point GIAO NMR calculations. Initially, four NMR shift calculation methods were compared: three were performed using the TMS-standard method at the HF/6-311+G(2d,p), B3LYP/6-311+G(2d,p), and mPW1PW91/6-31G(d) theory levels, and the fourth was performed with a multistandard approach using a mPW1PW91/6-31G(d) theory level. For the multistandard method, benzene was used as the standard for aromatic C and H atoms and methanol was used for aliphatic C and H atoms. The hydroxyl-H of methanol was used as the standard for hydroxyl-H atoms. The Boltzmann averaged results for six conformers showed that the multistandard method is more accurate for coniferyl alcohol and its dimers than the often used TMS-standard method, based on the mean unsigned, root-mean-squared, and maximum errors, as well as linear correlations between observed and calculated values. The (13)C results were more accurate than the (1)H results, due to poorer agreement between calculated hydroxyl-H results and observed data. Further Boltzmann-averaged, multistandard NMR calculations compared the (13)C and (1)H chemical shifts with experiment for the four stereoisomers of the \beta-O-4 dimer, as well as the 5-5, \beta-5, and \beta-\beta dimers of coniferyl alcohol. The (13)C results correlated well with experiment (r(2)&amp;amp;amp;gt;0.99) for all dimers and showed small statistical errors, compared with experiment.

Through example experiments, three themes are addressed relevant to obtaining meaningful results: considerations related to heterogeneity in the composition of wood (e.g., growth rings); the impact of the chemical removal of minor wood components known as extractives, and whether such a process is necessary; and the potential for misleading or erroneous results as a result of contamination occurring during sample preparation. In addition to discussing successful sample preparation approaches, the important role to be played by MVA in surface analysis is emphasized, particularly in the analysis of ToF-SIMS data. Examples of ToF-SIMS/MVA are provided that highlight the identification of contamination in sample preparation, the quantification of wood composition in terms of cellulose and lignin, and the indication of age of softwood samples.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Laccase and its role in production of extracellular reactive oxygen species during wood decay by the brown rot basidiomycete postia placenta;,citation_abstract=Brown rot basidiomycetes initiate wood decay by producing extracellular reactive oxygen species that depolymerize the structural polysaccharides of lignocellulose. Secreted fungal hydroquinones are considered one contributor because they have been shown to reduce Fe(3+), thus generating perhydroxyl radicals and Fe(2+), which subsequently react further to produce biodegradative hydroxyl radicals. However, many brown rot fungi also secrete high levels of oxalate, which chelates Fe(3+) tightly, making it unreactive with hydroquinones. For hydroquinone-driven hydroxyl radical production to contribute in this environment, an alternative mechanism to oxidize hydroquinones is required. We show here that aspen wood undergoing decay by the oxalate producer Postia placenta contained both 2,5-dimethoxyhydroquinone and laccase activity. Mass spectrometric analysis of proteins extracted from the wood identified a putative laccase (Joint Genome Institute P. placenta protein identification number 111314), and heterologous expression of the corresponding gene confirmed this assignment. Ultrafiltration experiments with liquid pressed from the biodegrading wood showed that a high-molecular-weight component was required for it to oxidize 2,5-dimethoxyhydroquinone rapidly and that this component was replaceable by P. placenta laccase. The purified laccase oxidized 2,5-dimethoxyhydroquinone with a second-order rate constant near 10(4) M(-1) s(-1), and measurements of the H(2)O(2) produced indicated that approximately one perhydroxyl radical was generated per hydroquinone supplied.

Third harmonic generation (THG) microscopy is a label-free scatter process that is elicited by water-lipid and water-protein interfaces, including intra- and extracellular membranes, and extracellular matrix structures. In applied life sciences, THG delivers a versatile contrast modality to complement multi-parameter fluorescence, second harmonic generation and fluorescence lifetime microscopy, which allows detection of cellular and molecular cell functions in three-dimensional tissue culture and small animals. In this Commentary, we review the physical and technical basis of THG, and provide considerations for optimal excitation, detection and interpretation of THG signals. We further provide an overview on how THG has versatile applications in cell and tissue research, with a particular focus on analyzing tissue morphogenesis and homeostasis, immune cell function and cancer research, as well as the emerging applicability of THG in clinical practice.;,citation_author=B.

In the present study we sequenced expressed sequence tags (ESTs) encoding novel heme-containing class III peroxidases from Arabidopsis thaliana and annotated 73 full-length genes identified in the genome. In total, transcripts of 58 of these genes have now been observed. The expression of individual peroxidase genes was assessed in organ-specific EST libraries and compared to the expression of 33 peroxidase genes which we analyzed in whole plants 3, 6, 15, 35 and 59 days after sowing. Expression was assessed in root, rosette leaf, stem, cauline leaf, flower bud and cell culture tissues using the gene-specific and highly sensitive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We predicted that 71 genes could yield stable proteins folded similarly to horseradish peroxidase (HRP). The putative mature peroxidases derived from these genes showed 28-94% amino acid sequence identity and were all targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum by N-terminal signal peptides. In 20 peroxidases these signal peptides were followed by various N-terminal extensions of unknown function which are not present in HRP. Ten peroxidases showed a C-terminal extension indicating vacuolar targeting. We found that the majority of peroxidase genes were expressed in root. In total, class III peroxidases accounted for an impressive 2.2% of root ESTs. Rather few peroxidases showed organ specificity. Most importantly, genes expressed constitutively in all organs and genes with a preference for root represented structurally diverse peroxidases (&amp;amp;lt; 70% sequence identity). Furthermore, genes appearing in tandem showed distinct expression profiles. The alignment of 73 Arabidopsis peroxidase sequences provides an easy access to the identification of orthologous peroxidases in other plant species and will provide a common platform for combining knowledge of peroxidase structure and function relationships obtained in various species.;,citation_author=Karen G.

Yet, when Pisum sativum roots are inoculated with the pea pathogen, Nectria haematococca, most newly generated root tips remain uninfected even though most roots develop lesions just behind the tip in the region of elongation. The resistance mechanism is unknown but is correlated spatially with the presence of border cells on the cap periphery. Previously, an array of &amp;amp;amp;gt;100 extracellular proteins was found to be released while border cell separation proceeds. Here we report that protein secretion from pea root caps is induced in correlation with border cell separation. When this root cap secretome’ was proteolytically degraded during inoculation of pea roots with N. haematococca, the percentage of infected root tips increased from 4 {+/-} 3% to 100%. In control experiments, protease treatment of conidia or roots had no effect on growth and development of the fungus or the plant. A complex of &amp;gt;100 extracellular proteins was confirmed, by multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT), to comprise the root cap secretome. In addition to defense related and signalling enzymes known to be present in the plant apoplast’ were ribosomal proteins, 14-3-3 proteins and others typically associated with intracellular localization but recently shown to be extracellular components of microbial biofilms.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Molecular studies of cellulose synthase supercomplex from cotton fiber reveal its unique biochemical properties;,citation_abstract=Cotton fiber is a highly elongated and thickened single cell that produces large quantities of cellulose, which is synthesized and assembled into cell wall microfibrils by the cellulose synthase complex (CSC).

This super CSC was observed in samples prepared using cotton fiber cells harvested during the SCW synthesis period but not from cotton stem tissue or any samples obtained from Arabidopsis. Knock-out of any of GhCesA 4, 7, and 8 resulted in the disappearance of the CSS and the production of fiber cells with no SCW thickening. Cotton fiber CSS showed significantly higher enzyme activity than samples prepared from knock-out cotton lines. We found that the microfibrils from the SCW of wild-type cotton fibers may contain 72 glucan chains in a bundle, unlike other plant materials studied. GhCesA4, 7, and 8 restored both the dwarf and reduced vascular bundle phenotypes of their orthologous Arabidopsis mutants, potentially by reforming the CSC hexamers. Genetic complementation was not observed when non-orthologous CesA genes were used, indicating that each of the three subunits is indispensable for CSC formation and for full cellulose synthase function.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Independent origins of syringyl lignin in vascular plants;,citation_abstract=Lycophytes arose in the early Silurian (\approx400 Mya) and represent a major lineage of vascular plants that has evolved in parallel with the ferns, gymnosperms, and angiosperms. A hallmark of vascular plants is the presence of the phenolic lignin heteropolymer in xylem and other sclerified cell types. Although syringyl lignin is often considered to be restricted in angiosperms, it has been detected in lycophytes as well. Here we report the characterization of a cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenase from the lycophyte Selaginella moellendorffii. Gene expression data, cross-species complementation experiments, and in vitro enzyme assays indicate that this P450 is a ferulic acid/coniferaldehyde/coniferyl alcohol 5-hydroxylase (F5H), and is capable of diverting guaiacyl-substituted intermediates into syringyl lignin biosynthesis.

The development of lignin biosynthesis has been considered to be one of the key factors that allowed land plants to flourish in terrestrial ecosystems. Lignin provides structural rigidity for tracheophytes to stand upright, and strengthens the cell wall of their water-conducting tracheary elements to withstand the negative pressure generated during transpiration. In this review, we discuss a number of aspects regarding the origin and evolution of lignin bio-synthesis during land plant evolution, including the establishment of its monomer biosynthetic scaffold, potential precursors to the lignin polymer, as well as the emergence of the polymerization machinery and regulatory system.

In an apparent example of this process, syringyl lignin, a fundamental building block of plant cell walls, occurs in two major plant lineages, lycophytes and angiosperms, which diverged from one another more than 400 million years ago. Here, we show that this convergence resulted from independent recruitment of lignin biosynthetic cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenases that route cell wall monomers through related but distinct pathways in the two lineages. In contrast with angiosperms, in which syringyl lignin biosynthesis requires two phenylpropanoid meta-hydroxylases C3’H and F5H, the lycophyte Selaginella employs one phenylpropanoid dual meta-hydroxylase to bypass several steps of the canonical lignin biosynthetic pathway. Transgenic expression of the Selaginella hydroxylase in Arabidopsis thaliana dramatically reroutes its endogenous lignin biosynthetic pathway, yielding a novel lignin composition not previously identified in nature. Our findings demonstrate a unique case of convergent evolution via distinct biochemical strategies and suggest a new way to genetically reconstruct lignin biosynthesis in higher plants.;,citation_author=Jing-Ke Weng;,citation_author=Takuya Akiyama;,citation_author=Nicholas D.

The modified plants showed significantly improved cell-wall enzymatic saccharification efficiency without a reduction in post-harvest biomass yield despite the alterations in the overall growth morphology.

The microprobe allows spectra to be recorded from domains as small as 1 \mum, so that, for fibers of simple morphology, the polarization of exciting and scattered radiation can be defined relative to molecular orientation. Series of spectra in which the polarization of the incident light was varied relative to the fiber axis were recorded from oriented fibers. Analysis of band intensities as a function of polarization revealed new information about the directional character of the vibrational displacements. In addition, a limited study of deuterated celluloses was conducted in order to identify the modes that involve hydrogen motions. The information from the studies of intensities and deuterated celluloses aided in the interpretation of the vibrational spectrum of cellulose. Although a complete assignment of the spectrum was not possible, this new information provides a more thorough characterization of the bands than had been possible in previous studies, and establishes a foundation for future microprobe studies of native tissues.;,citation_author=James H.

Herein, we describe the isolation of a transferase gene capable of forming these conjugates and its xylem-specific introduction into poplar. Enzyme kinetics, in planta expression, lignin structural analysis, and improved cell wall digestibility after mild alkaline pretreatment demonstrate that these trees produce the monolignol ferulate conjugates, export them to the wall, and use them during lignification.

Conductances of transpiring leaves were 50% lower in pH 7.0 than in pH 6.0 buffers, but bulk leaf abscisic acid (ABA) concentration and shoot water status were unaffected by pH. Stomatal apertures of isolated abaxial epidermis incubated on simple buffers increased with external pH, so in vivo this must be overridden by alternative pH effects. Reductions in leaf transpiration rate at pH 7.0 were dependent on the presence of 10–8 mol dm-3 ABA in the xylem stream. We inferred that at pH 7.0 leaf apoplastic ABA concentrations increased: pH did not affect distributions of ABA among leaf tissues, but isolated epidermis and mesophyll tissue took up more 3H-ABA from pH 6.0 than from pH 7.0 buffers. The apoplastic ABA increase at pH 7.0 may result from reduced symplastic sequestration. A portion of 3H-ABA uptake by the epidermis was saturable at pH 6.0 but not at pH 7.0. An ABA uptake carrier may contribute to ABA sequestration by the leaf symplast of well-watered plants, and its inactivity at pH 7.0 may favor apoplastic ABA accumulation in draughted plants. Effects of external pH on stomatal apertures in the isolated epidermis indicate that published data supporting a role for internal guard cell ABA receptors should be reassessed.;,citation_author=S.

The present review describes laccase and its product melanin as an important virulence factor of Cryptococcus neoformans and illustrates the approaches used in elucidating the pathogenesis of cryptococcosis. Characterization of the biochemical pathways leading to melanin synthesis is summarized using biochemical and biomolecular approaches. Melanin synthesis is dependent on a single copper-dependent enzyme, laccase. Since the mammalian host does not contain this enzyme, laccase is an attractive candidate for the study of fungal pathogenesis, as well as a drug target. The cloning of the CNLAC1 gene and construction of CNLAC1 gene knock-out strains has confirmed its role in the virulence of Cryptococcus. Also described is the role of melanin in the host-pathogen interactions.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The molecular basis of plant cellulose synthase complex organisation and assembly;,citation_abstract=The material properties of cellulose are heavily influenced by the organisation of \beta-1,4-glucan chains into a microfibril. It is likely that the structure of this microfibril is determined by the spatial arrangement of catalytic cellulose synthase (CESA) proteins within the cellulose synthase complex (CSC). In land plants, CESA proteins form a large complex composed of a hexamer of trimeric lobes termed the rosette. Each rosette synthesises a single microfibril likely composed of 18 glucan chains. In this review, the biochemical events leading to plant CESA protein assembly into the rosette are explored. The protein interfaces responsible for CESA trimerization are formed by regions that define rosette-forming CESA proteins. As a consequence, these regions are absent from the ancestral bacterial cellulose synthases (BcsAs) that do not form rosettes. CSC assembly occurs within the context of the endomembrane system, however the site of CESA assembly into trimers and rosettes is not determined. Both the N-Terminal Domain and Class Specific Region of CESA proteins are intrinsically disordered and contain all of the identified phosphorylation sites, making both regions candidates as sites for protein–protein interactions and inter–lobe interface formation. We propose a sequential assembly model, whereby CESA proteins form stable trimers shortly after native folding, followed by sequential recruitment of lobes into a rosette, possibly assisted by Golgi-localised STELLO proteins. A comprehensive understanding of CESA assembly into the CSC will enable directed engineering of CESA protein spatial arrangements, allowing changes in cellulose crystal packing that alter its material properties.;,citation_author=Thomas H Wilson;,citation_author=Manoj Kumar;,citation_author=Simon R Turner;,citation_publication_date=2021-02;,citation_cover_date=2021-02;,citation_year=2021;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1042/BST20200697;,citation_issn=0300-5127;,citation_volume=49;,citation_journal_title=Biochem.

The mechanism of the interaction between CSCs and MTs, and the cellular determinants that control the delivery of CSCs at the PM, are not yet well understood. We identified a unique small molecule, CESA TRAFFICKING INHIBITOR (CESTRIN), which reduces cellulose content and alters the anisotropic growth of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) hypocotyls. We monitored the distribution and mobility of fluorescently labeled cellulose synthases (CESAs) in live Arabidopsis cells under chemical exposure to characterize their subcellular effects. CESTRIN reduces the velocity of PM &nbsp;CSCs and causes their accumulation in the cell cortex. The CSC-associated proteins KORRIGAN1 (KOR1) and POM2/CELLULOSE SYNTHASE INTERACTIVE PROTEIN1 (CSI1) were differentially affected by CESTRIN treatment, indicating different forms of association with the PM &nbsp;CSCs. KOR1 accumulated in bodies similar to CESA; however, POM2/CSI1 dissociated into the cytoplasm. In addition, MT stability was altered without direct inhibition of MT polymerization, suggesting a feedback mechanism caused by cellulose interference. The selectivity of CESTRIN was assessed using a variety of subcellular markers for which no morphological effect was observed. The association of CESAs with vesicles decorated by the trans-Golgi network-localized protein SYNTAXIN OF PLANTS61 (SYP61) was increased under CESTRIN treatment, implicating SYP61 compartments in CESA trafficking. The properties of CESTRIN compared with known CESA inhibitors afford unique avenues to study and understand the mechanism under which PM-associated CSCs are maintained and interact with MTs and to dissect their trafficking routes in etiolated hypocotyls.;,citation_author=Natasha Worden;,citation_author=Thomas E.

But few attentions were given to the biological role of laccase2 in the synthesizing of similar structures, such as oothecae, eggshell, or silk cocoons. We cloned laccase2 gene from Aedes albopictus, one main mosquito vector of dengue virus in China. An upregulation of laccase2 gene was observed after a blood meal in female adult mosquitoes, suggesting that laccase2 gene may have an involvement in the development of ovary. RNA interference experiment was performed by using adult female mosquitoes. Female mosquitoes were injected with 20 ng of double-strain RNA into the thorax. Pigmentation of mosquito eggshell was blocked that these eggs never became dark. And the incomplete sclerotization of eggshell weakened the stability and flexibility of the eggs. These eggs without enough protection were deformed and died in water. These results demonstrate that laccase2 plays a critical role in the development of eggs of A. albopictus.

In this study, putatively novel switchgrass C20 GA2ox genes were identified with the aim of genetically engineering switchgrass for improved architecture and reduced biomass recalcitrance for biofuel. Three C20 GA2ox genes showed differential regulation patterns among tissues including roots, seedlings and reproductive parts. Using a transgenic approach, we showed that overexpression of two C20 GA2ox genes, that is PvGA2ox5 and PvGA2ox9, resulted in characteristic GA-deficient phenotypes with dark-green leaves and modified plant architecture. The changes in plant morphology appeared to be associated with GA2ox transcript abundance. Exogenous application of GA rescued the GA-deficient phenotypes in transgenic lines. Transgenic semi-dwarf lines displayed increased tillering and reduced lignin content, and the syringyl/guaiacyl lignin monomer ratio accompanied by the reduced expression of lignin biosynthetic genes compared to nontransgenic plants. A moderate increase in the level of glucose release in these transgenic lines might be attributed to reduced biomass recalcitrance as a result of reduced lignin content and lignin composition.

We quantified the concentrations of eight biochemical fractions and nitrogen (N) in leaf litter and fine roots at four sugar maple (Acer saccharum)-dominated hardwood forests in the north-central United States. We combined these results with litter production data to estimate ecosystem biochemical fluxes to soil. We also compared how leaf litter and fine root biochemistry responded to long-term simulated N deposition. Compared with leaf litter, fine roots contained 2.9-fold higher acid-insoluble fraction (AIF) and 2.3-fold more condensed tannins; both are relatively difficult to decompose. Comparatively, leaf litter had greater quantities of more labile components: nonstructural carbohydrates, cellulose and soluble phenolics. At an ecosystem scale, fine roots contributed over two-thirds of the fluxes of AIF and condensed tannins to soil. Fine root biochemistry was also less responsive than leaf litter to long-term simulated N deposition. Fine roots were the dominant source of difficult-to-decompose plant carbon fractions entering the soil at our four study sites.

Loss of the xyloglucan galactosyltransferase MURUS3 (MUR3) leads to the deficiency of galactosylated xyloglucan and perturbs plant growth. However, it is unclear whether defects in xyloglucan galactosylation influence the synthesis of other wall polysaccharides, cell wall integrity, cytoskeleton behaviour, and endomembrane homeostasis. Here, we found that in mur3-7 etiolated seedlings cellulose was reduced, CELLULOSE SYNTHASE (CESA) genes were down-regulated, the density and mobility of cellulose synthase complexes (CSCs) were decreased, and cellulose microfibrils become discontinuous. Pectin, rhamnogalacturonan II (RGII), and boron contents were reduced in mur3-7 plants, and B-RGII cross-linking was abnormal. Wall porosity and thickness were significantly increased in mur3-7 seedlings. Endomembrane aggregation was also apparent in the mur3-7 mutant. Furthermore, mutant seedlings and their actin filaments were more sensitive to Latrunculin A (LatA) treatment. However, all defects in mur3-7 mutants were substantially restored by exogenous boric acid application.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Activation tagging of Arabidopsis POLYGALACTURONASE INVOLVED IN EXPANSION2 promotes hypocotyl elongation, leaf expansion, stem lignification, mechanical stiffening, and lodging;,citation_abstract=Pectin is the most abundant component of primary cell walls in eudicot plants. The modification and degra- dation of pectin affects multiple processes during plant development, including cell expansion, organ initia- tion, and cell separation. However, the extent to which pectin degradation by polygalacturonases affects stem development and secondary wall formation remains unclear. Using an activation tag screen, we identi- fied a transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana line with longer etiolated hypocotyls, which overexpresses a gene encoding a polygalacturonase. We designated this gene as POLYGALACTURONASE INVOLVED IN EXPAN- SION2 (PGX2), and the corresponding activation tagged line as PGX2AT. PGX2 is widely expressed in young seedlings and in roots, stems, leaves, flowers, and siliques of adult plants. PGX2-GFP localizes to the cell wall, and PGX2AT plants show higher total polygalacturonase activity and smaller pectin molecular masses than wild-type controls, supporting a function for this protein in apoplastic pectin degradation. A heterolo- gously expressed, truncated version of PGX2 also displays polygalacturonase activity in vitro. Like previ- ously identified PGX1AT plants, PGX2AT plants have longer hypocotyls and larger rosette leaves, but they also uniquely display early flowering, earlier stem lignification, and lodging stems with enhanced mechani- cal stiffness that is possibly due to decreased stem thickness. Together, these results indicate that PGX2 both functions in cell expansion and influences secondary wall formation, providing a possible link between these two developmental processes.;,citation_author=Chaowen Xiao;,citation_author=William J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=From the Soft to the Hard: Changes in Microchemistry During Cell Wall Maturation of Walnut Shells;,citation_abstract=The walnut shell is a hard and protective layer that provides an essential barrier between the seed and its environment. The shell is based on only one unit cell type: the polylobate sclerenchyma cell. For a better understanding of the interlocked walnut shell tissue, we investigate the structural and compositional changes during the development of the shell from the soft to the hard state. Structural changes at the macro level are explored by X-ray tomography and on the cell and cell wall level various microscopic techniques are applied. Walnut shell development takes place beneath the outer green husk, which protects and delivers components during the development of the walnut. The cells toward this outer green husk have the thickest and most lignified cell walls. With maturation secondary cell wall thickening takes place and the amount of all cell wall components (cellulose, hemicelluloses and especially lignin) is increased as revealed by FTIR microscopy. Focusing on the cell wall level, Raman imaging showed that lignin is deposited first into the pectin network between the cells and cell corners, at the very beginning of secondary cell wall formation. Furthermore, Raman imaging of fluorescence visualized numerous pits as a network of channels, connecting all the interlocked polylobate walnut shells. In the final mature stage, fluorescence increased throughout the cell wall and a fluorescent layer was detected toward the lumen in the inner part. This accumulation of aromatic components is reminiscent of heartwood formation of trees and is suggested to improve protection properties of the mature walnut shell. Understanding the walnut shell and its development will inspire biomimetic material design and packaging concepts, but is also important for waste valorization, considering that walnuts are the most widespread tree nuts in the world.;,citation_author=Nannan Xiao;,citation_author=Peter Bock;,citation_author=Sebastian J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Brassinosteroids can regulate cellulose biosynthesis by controlling the expression of CESA genes in Arabidopsis;,citation_abstract=The phytohormones, brassinosteroids (BRs), play important roles in regulating cell elongation and cell size, and BR-related mutants in Arabidopsis display significant dwarf phenotypes. Cellulose is a biopolymer which has a major contribution to cell wall formation during cell expansion and elongation. However, whether BRs regulate cellulose synthesis, and if so, what the underlying mechanism of cell elongation induced by BRs is, is unknown. The content of cellulose and the expression levels of the cellulose synthase genes (CESAs) was measured in BR-related mutants and their wild-type counterpart. The chromatin immunoprecipitation (CHIP) experiments and genetic analysis were used to demonstrate that BRs regulate CESA genes. It was found here that the BR-deficient or BR-perceptional mutants contain less cellulose than the wild type. The expression of CESA genes, especially those related to primary cell wall synthesis, was reduced in det2-1 and bri1-301, and was only inducible by BRs in the BR-deficient mutant det2-1. CHIP experiments show that the BR-activated transcription factor BES1 can associate with upstream elements of most CESA genes particularly those related with the primary cell wall. Furthermore, over-expression of the BR receptor BRI1 in CESA1, 3, and 6 mutants can only partially rescue the dwarf phenotypes. Our findings provide potential insights into the mechanism that BRs regulate cellulose synthesis to accomplish the cell elongation process in plant development.;,citation_author=Liqiong Xie;,citation_author=Cangjing Yang;,citation_author=Xuelu Wang;,citation_publication_date=2011-08;,citation_cover_date=2011-08;,citation_year=2011;,citation_issue=13;,citation_doi=10.1093/jxb/err164;,citation_issn=0022-0957;,citation_volume=62;,citation_journal_title=J.

This system uses a small guide RNA (gRNA) to direct Cas9 endonuclease to a specific DNA site; thus, its targeting capability is largely constrained by the gRNA-expressing device. In this study, we developed a general strategy to produce numerous gRNAs from a single polycistronic gene. The endogenous tRNA-processing system, which precisely cleaves both ends of the tRNA precursor, was engineered as a simple and robust platform to boost the targeting and multiplex editing capability of the CRISPR/ Cas9 system. We demonstrated that synthetic genes with tandemly arrayed tRNA–gRNA architecture were efficiently and precisely processed into gRNAs with desired 5\prime targeting sequences in vivo, which directed Cas9 to edit multiple chromosomal targets. Using this strategy, multiplex genome editing and chromosomal-fragment deletion were readily achieved in stable transgenic rice plants with a high efficiency (up to 100%). Because tRNA and its processing system are virtually conserved in all living organisms, this method could be broadly used to boost the targeting capability and editing efficiency of CRISPR/Cas9 toolkits.;,citation_author=Kabin Xie;,citation_author=Bastian Minkenberg;,citation_author=Yinong Yang;,citation_publication_date=2015;,citation_cover_date=2015;,citation_year=2015;,citation_issue=11;,citation_doi=10.1073/pnas.1420294112;,citation_isbn=1091-6490 (Electronic){\textbackslash}r0027-8424 (Linking);,citation_issn=0027-8424;,citation_pmid=25733849;,citation_volume=112;,citation_journal_title=Proc.

Cellulose microfibrils are a major determinant for anisotropic growth and they provide the scaffold for cell wall assembly. Little is known about how acid growth depends on cell wall architecture. To explore the relationship between acid growth-mediated cell elongation and plant cell wall architecture, two mutants (jia1-1 and csi1-3) that are defective in cellulose biosynthesis and cellulose microfibril organization were analyzed. The study revealed that cell elongation is dependent on CSI1-mediated cell wall architecture but not on the overall crystalline cellulose content. We observed a correlation between loss of crossed-polylamellate walls and loss of auxin- and fusicoccin-induced cell growth in csi1-3. Furthermore, induced loss of crossed-polylamellate walls via disruption of cortical microtubules mimics the effect of csi1 in acid growth.

The observed K(m) and kcat were correlated to the structure of substrate. The change in log (kcat/K(m)) was found to be proportional to the one-electron redox potential difference between laccase’s type 1 copper site and substrate. This correlation indicated that the first electron transfer from substrate to laccase was governed by the &amp;amp;amp;quot;outersphere&amp;quot; mechanism. Compared to the electronic factor, the steric effect of small o-substituents (such as methyl and methoxy groups) was found to be unimportant.

The laccases showed a single spectrally detectable acid-base transition at pH 6-9 and a fluoride inhibition that diminished by increased pH (indicating a competition with hydroxide inhibition). Relatively small changes in the redox potentials (&amp;amp;amp;lt; or = 0.1 V) of laccase were observed over the pH 2.7-11. Under the catalysis of laccase, the apparent oxidation rates (kcat and kcat/Km) of two nonphenolic substrates, potassium ferrocyanide and 2,2’-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid), decreased monotonically as the pH increased.

By correlating these pH dependences, it is proposed that the balance of two opposing effects, one generated by the redox potential difference between a reducing substrate and the type 1 copper of laccase (which correlates to the electron transfer rate and is favored for a phenolic substrate by higher pH) and another generated by the binding of a hydroxide anion to the type 2/type 3 coppers of laccase (which inhibits the activity at higher pH), contributes to the pH activity profile of the fungal laccases.;,citation_author=Feng Xu;,citation_publication_date=1997;,citation_cover_date=1997;,citation_year=1997;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1074/jbc.272.2.924;,citation_isbn=0021-9258 (Print);,citation_issn=00219258;,citation_pmid=8995383;,citation_volume=272;,citation_journal_title=J.

We identified two Leu-rich repeat receptor-like kinases in Arabidopsis thaliana that play a role in regulating cell wall function. Mutations in these FEI1 and FEI2 genes (named for the Chinese word for fat) disrupt anisotropic expansion and the synthesis of cell wall polymers and act additively with inhibitors or mutations disrupting cellulose biosynthesis. While FEI1 is an active protein kinase, a kinase-inactive version of FEI1 was able to fully complement the fei1 fei2 mutant. The expansion defect in fei1 fei2 roots was suppressed by inhibition of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) synthase, an enzyme that converts Ado-Met to ACC in ethylene biosynthesis, but not by disruption of the ethylene response pathway. Furthermore, the FEI proteins interact directly with ACC synthase. These results suggest that the FEI proteins define a novel signaling pathway that regulates cell wall function, likely via an ACC-mediated signal.;,citation_author=Shou-Ling Xu;,citation_author=Abidur Rahman;,citation_author=Tobias I.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Contribution of NAC Transcription Factors to Plant Adaptation to Land;,citation_abstract=From Drips to Tubes In the evolutionary transition from aquatic to terrestrial habitats, plants acquired internal systems to transport water and provide structural support. Xu et al. (p. 1505, published online 20 March) studied a family of genes and the cells they control to better understand the innovations required to adapt to dry land. In Arabidopsis, specific transcription factors regulate development of xylem—the plant tissue that transports water. The moss Physcomitrella patens has similar genes, which regulate development of hydroids and stereids, cells specialized in water transport and structural support. The similarity in the genes and their functions suggests the evolutionary origins of land-plant vascular systems. The development of cells specialized for water conduction or support is a striking innovation of plants that has enabled them to colonize land. The NAC transcription factors regulate the differentiation of these cells in vascular plants. However, the path by which plants with these cells have evolved from their nonvascular ancestors is unclear. We investigated genes of the moss Physcomitrella patens that encode NAC proteins. Loss-of-function mutants formed abnormal water-conducting and supporting cells, as well as malformed sporophyte cells, and overexpression induced ectopic differentiation of water-conducting–like cells. Our results show conservation of transcriptional regulation and cellular function between moss and Arabidopsis thaliana water-conducting cells. The conserved genetic basis suggests roles for NAC proteins in the adaptation of plants to land.

Here, we establish root-synthesized glucosinolates (GLS) are in Arabidopsis as a model to study the transport routes of plant-derived metabolites from the site of synthesis to the rhizosphere. Analysing the expression of GLS synthetic genes in the root indicate that the stele is the major site for the synthesis of aliphatic GLS, whereas indole GLS can be synthesized in both the stele and the cortex. Sampling root exudates from the wild type and the double mutant of the GLS importers GTR1 and GTR2 show that GTR-mediated retention of stele-synthesized GLS is a prerequisite for the exudation of both intact GLS and their catabolites into the rhizosphere. The expression of the GTRs inside the stele, combined with the previous observation that GLS are exported from biosynthetic cells, suggest three possible routes of stele-synthesized aliphatic GLS after their synthesis: (i) GTR-dependent import to cells symplastically connected to the cortical cells and the rhizosphere; (ii) GTR-independent transport via the xylem to the shoot; and (iii) GTR-dependent import to GLS-degrading myrosin cells at the cortex.

The source and route of S-cell-bound GLS remain elusive. In this study, using single-cell sampling and scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray analysis we show that two GLS importers, NPF2.10/GTR1 and NPF2.11/GTR2, are critical for GLS accumulation in S-cells, although they are not localized in the S-cells. Comparison of GLS levels in S-cells in multiple combinations of homo- and heterografts of gtr1 gtr2, biosynthetic null mutant and wild-type plants indicate that S-cells accumulate GLS via symplasmic connections either directly from neighboring biosynthetic cells or indirectly to non-neighboring cells expressing GTR1/2. Distinct sources and transport routes exist for different types of GLS, and vary depending on the position of S-cells in the inflorescence stem. Based on these findings, we propose a model illustrating the GLS transport routes either directly from biosynthetic cells or via GTR-mediated import from apoplastic space radially into a symplasmic domain, wherein the S-cells are the ultimate sink.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Secondary cell wall patterning—connecting the dots, pits and helices;,citation_abstract=All plant cells are encased in primary cell walls that determine plant morphology, but also protect the cells against the environment. Certain cells also produce a secondary wall that supports mechanically demanding processes, such as maintaining plant body stature and water transport inside plants. Both these walls are primarily composed of polysaccharides that are arranged in certain patterns to support cell functions. A key requisite for patterned cell walls is the arrangement of cortical microtubules that may direct the delivery of wall polymers and/or cell wall producing enzymes to certain plasma membrane locations. Microtubules also steer the synthesis of cellulose—the load-bearing structure in cell walls—at the plasma membrane. The organization and behaviour of the microtubule array are thus of fundamental importance to cell wall patterns. These aspects are controlled by the coordinated effort of small GTPases that probably coordinate a Turing’s reaction–diffusion mechanism to drive microtubule patterns. Here, we give an overview on how wall patterns form in the water-transporting xylem vessels of plants.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor lipid remodeling directs proteins to the plasma membrane and governs cell wall mechanics;,citation_abstract=Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchoring is a common protein modification that targets proteins to the plasma membrane (PM). Knowledge about the GPI lipid tail, which guides the secretion of GPI-anchored proteins (GPI-APs), is limited in plants. Here, we report that rice (Oryza sativa) BRITTLE CULM16 (BC16), a membrane-bound O-acyltransferase (MBOAT) remodels GPI lipid tails and governs cell wall biomechanics. The bc16 mutant exhibits fragile internodes, resulting from reduced cell wall thickness and cellulose content. BC16 is the only MBOAT in rice and is located in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. Yeast gup1\Delta mutant restoring assay and GPI lipid composition analysis demonstrated BC16 as a GPI lipid remodelase. Loss of BC16 alters GPI lipid structure and disturbs the targeting of BC1, a GPI-AP for cellulose biosynthesis, to the PM lipid nanodomains. Atomic force microscopy revealed compromised deposition of cellulosic nanofibers in bc16, leading to an increased Young’s modulus and abnormal mechanical properties. Therefore, BC16-mediated lipid remodeling directs the GPI-APs, such as BC1, to the cell surface to fulfill multiple functions, including cellulose organization. Our work unravels a mechanism by which GPI lipids are remodeled in plants and provides insights into the control of cell wall biomechanics, offering a tool for breeding elite crops with improved support strength.;,citation_author=Zuopeng Xu;,citation_author=Yihong Gao;,citation_author=Chengxu Gao;,citation_author=Jiasong Mei;,citation_author=Shaogan Wang;,citation_author=Jiaxin Ma;,citation_author=Hanlei Yang;,citation_author=Shaoxue Cao;,citation_author=Yan Wang;,citation_author=Fengxia Zhang;,citation_author=Xiangling Liu;,citation_author=Qiaoquan Liu;,citation_author=Yihua Zhou;,citation_author=Baocai Zhang;,citation_publication_date=2022-08;,citation_cover_date=2022-08;,citation_year=2022;,citation_doi=10.1093/plcell/koac257;,citation_issn=1040-4651;,citation_journal_title=Plant Cell;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Dynamic GOLVEN-ROOT GROWTH FACTOR 1 INSENSITIVE signaling in the root cap mediates root gravitropism;,citation_abstract=Throughout the exploration of the soil, roots interact with their environment and adapt to different conditions. Directional root growth is guided by asymmetric molecular patterns but how these become established or are dynamically regulated is poorly understood. Asymmetric gradients of the phytohormone auxin are established during root gravitropism, mainly through directional transport mediated by polarized auxin transporters. Upon gravistimulation, PIN-FORMED2 (PIN2) is differentially distributed and accumulates at the lower root side to facilitate asymmetric auxin transport up to the elongation zone where it inhibits cell elongation. GOLVEN (GLV) peptides function in gravitropism by affecting PIN2 abundance in epidermal cells. In addition, GLV signaling through ROOT GROWTH FACTOR 1 INSENSITIVE (RGI) receptors regulates root apical meristem maintenance. Here, we show that GLV-RGI signaling in these 2 processes in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) can be mapped to different cells in the root tip and that, in the case of gravitropism, it operates mainly in the lateral root cap (LRC) to maintain PIN2 levels at the plasma membrane (PM). Furthermore, we found that GLV signaling upregulates the phosphorylation level of PIN2 in an RGI-dependent manner. In addition, we demonstrated that the RGI5 receptor is asymmetrically distributed in the LRC and accumulates in the lower side of the LRC after gravistimulation. Asymmetric GLV-RGI signaling in the root cap likely accounts for differential PIN2 abundance at the PM to temporarily support auxin transport up to the elongation zone, thereby representing an additional level of control on the asymmetrical auxin flux to mediate differential growth of the root.;,citation_author=Ke Xu;,citation_author=Joris Jourquin;,citation_author=Xiangyu Xu;,citation_author=Ive De Smet;,citation_author=Ana I Fernandez;,citation_author=Tom Beeckman;,citation_publication_date=2023-05;,citation_cover_date=2023-05;,citation_year=2023;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1093/plphys/kiad073;,citation_issn=0032-0889;,citation_volume=192;,citation_journal_title=Plant Physiol.;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Export of defensive glucosinolates is key for their accumulation in seeds;,citation_abstract=Plant membrane transporters controlling metabolite distribution contribute key agronomic traits1–6. To eliminate anti-nutritional factors in edible parts of crops, the mutation of importers can block the accumulation of these factors in sink tissues7. However, this often results in a substantially altered distribution pattern within the plant8–12, whereas engineering of exporters may prevent such changes in distribution. In brassicaceous oilseed crops, anti-nutritional glucosinolate defence compounds are translocated to the seeds. However, the molecular targets for export engineering of glucosinolates remain unclear. Here we identify and characterize members of the USUALLY MULTIPLE AMINO ACIDS MOVE IN AND OUT TRANSPORTER (UMAMIT) family—UMAMIT29, UMAMIT30 and UMAMIT31—in Arabidopsis thaliana as glucosinolate exporters with a uniport mechanism. Loss-of-function umamit29 umamit30 umamit31 triple mutants have a very low level of seed glucosinolates, demonstrating a key role for these transporters in translocating glucosinolates into seeds.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=CCR1, an enzyme required for lignin biosynthesis in Arabidopsis, mediates cell proliferation exit for leaf development;,citation_abstract=After initiation, leaves first undergo a rapid cell proliferation process. During subsequent development, leaf cells gradually exit from their proliferation phase and enter the expansion stage with a basipetally ordered pattern starting at the leaf tip. The molecular mechanism directing this pattern for leaf development is yet poorly understood. By genetic screening and characterization of Arabidopsis mutants defective in the exit of cell proliferation, we show that the CINNAMOYL-CoA REDUCTASE (CCR1) gene, which is required for lignin biosynthesis, participates in the process of cell proliferation exit in leaves. CCR1 is expressed basipetally in the leaf, and the ccr1 mutants exhibited multiple abnormalities including increased cell proliferation. The ccr1 phenotypes are not due to the reduced lignin content, but the dramatically increased level of ferulic acid (FeA), an intermediate in lignin biosynthesis. FeA is known to have antioxidant activity, and levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in ccr1 were reduced markedly. We also characterized another double mutant in CAFFEIC ACID O-METHYLTRANSFERASE (comt) and CAFFEOYL CoA 3-O-METHYLTRANSFERASE (ccoaomt), in which the FeA level was dramatically reduced. Cell proliferation in comt ccoaomt leaves was decreased accompanied by elevated ROS levels, and the mutant phenotypes could be partially rescued by treatments with FeA or another antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine. Taken together, our results suggest that CCR1, FeA and ROS coordinate the cell proliferation exit for normal leaf development. This article is protected by copyright.

Spectral analyses showed that the autofluorescence of Lilium and Arabidopsis sporopollenin is similar to that of lignin. Thioacidolysis and NMR analyses of pollen from Lilium and Cryptomeria further revealed that the sporopollenin of seed plants contains phenylpropanoid derivatives, including p-hydroxybenzoate (p-BA), p-coumarate (p-CA), ferulate (FA), and lignin guaiacyl (G) units. The phenylpropanoid pathway is expressed in the tapetum in Arabidopsis, consistent with the fact that the sporopollenin precursor originates from the tapetum. Further germination and comet assays showed that this pathway plays an important role in protection of pollen against UV radiation. In the pteridophyte plant&nbsp;species Ophioglossum vulgatum and Lycopodium clavata, phenylpropanoid derivatives including p-BA and p-CA were also detected, but G units were not.

Indeed, many neuroscientists regard brain slices as the gold-standard model system for detailed cellular, molecular, and circuitry level analysis and perturbation of neuronal function. A critical limitation of this model system is the difficulty in preparing slices from adult and aging animals, and over the past several decades few substantial methodological improvements have emerged to facilitate patch clamp analysis in the mature adult stage. In this chapter we describe a robust and practical protocol for preparing brain slices from mature adult mice that are suitable for patch clamp analysis. This method reduces swelling and damage in superficial layers of the slices and improves the success rate for targeted patch clamp recordings, including recordings from fluorescently labeled populations in slices derived from transgenic mice. This adult brain slice method is suitable for diverse experimental applications, including both monitoring and manipulating neuronal activity with genetically encoded calcium indicators and optogenetic actuators, respectively.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Engineering secondary cell wall deposition in plants;,citation_abstract=Lignocellulosic biomass was used for thousands of years as animal feed and is now considered a great sugar source for biofuels production. It is composed mostly of secondary cell walls built with polysaccharide polymers that are embedded in lignin to reinforce the cell wall structure and maintain its integrity. Lignin is the primary material responsible for biomass recalcitrance to enzymatic hydrolysis. During plant development, deep reductions of lignin cause growth defects and often correlate with the loss of vessel integrity that adversely affects water and nutrient transport in plants. The work presented here describes a new approach to decrease lignin content while preventing vessel collapse and introduces a new strategy to boost transcription factor expression in native tissues. We used synthetic biology tools in Arabidopsis to rewire the secondary cell network by changing promoter-coding sequence associations. The result was a reduction in lignin and an increase in polysaccharide depositions in fibre cells. The promoter of a key lignin gene, C4H, was replaced by the vessel-specific promoter of transcription factor VND6. This rewired lignin biosynthesis specifically for vessel formation while disconnecting C4H expression from the fibre regulatory network. Secondly, the promoter of the IRX8 gene, secondary cell wall glycosyltransferase, was used to express a new copy of the fibre transcription factor NST1, and as the IRX8 promoter is induced by NST1, this also created an artificial positive feedback loop (APFL). The combination of strategies-lignin rewiring with APFL insertion-enhances polysaccharide deposition in stems without over-lignifying them, resulting in higher sugar yields after enzymatic hydrolysis.;,citation_author=Fan Yang;,citation_author=Prajakta Mitra;,citation_author=Ling Zhang;,citation_author=Lina Prak;,citation_author=Yves Verhertbruggen;,citation_author=Jin Sun Kim;,citation_author=Lan Sun;,citation_author=Kejian Zheng;,citation_author=Kexuan Tang;,citation_author=Manfred Auer;,citation_author=Henrik V.

Results showed that prolonging ball milling time from 3 to 7&nbsp;h obviously increased the isolation yields of MWL in bamboo residues (from 39.2% to 53.9%) and poplar sawdust (from 15.5% to 35.6%), while only a slight increase was found for the MWL yield of larch sawdust (from 23.4% to 25.8%). Importantly, the lignin substructure of ß-O-4 in the MWL samples from different biomasses can be a little degraded with the increasing ball milling time, resulting in the prepared MWL with lower molecular weight and higher content of hydroxyl groups.

Cellulose synthase complexes are guided by the microtubule cytoskeleton, but it is unclear which proteins mediate this process in the seed coat epidermis. Using reverse genetics, we identified IQ67 DOMAIN 9 (IQD9) and KINESIN LIGHT CHAIN-RELATED 1 (KLCR1) as two highly expressed genes during seed development and comprehensively characterized their roles in cell wall polysaccharide biosynthesis. Mutations in IQD9 as well as in KLCR1 lead to compact mucilage capsules with aberrant cellulose distribution, which can be rescued by transgene complementation. IQD9 physically interacts with KLCR1 and localizes to cortical microtubules (MTs) to maintain their organization in seed coat epidermal (SCE) cells. IQD9 as well as a previously identified TONNEAU1 (TON1) RECRUITING MOTIF 4 (TRM4) protein act to maintain cellulose synthase velocity. Our results demonstrate that IQD9, KLCR1 and TRM4 are MT-associated proteins that are required for seed mucilage architecture.

Genes encoding oxidases and DIRs for neolignan biosynthesis have not been identified previously. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the DIR AtDP1/AtDIR12 plays an essential role in the 8-O-4\prime coupling in neolignan biosynthesis by unequivocal structural determination of the compound missing in the atdp1 mutant as a sinapoylcholine (SC)-conjugated neolignan, erythro-3-{4-[2-hydroxy-2-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-1-hydroxymethylethoxy]-3,5-dimethoxyphenyl}acryloylcholine. Phylogenetic analyses showed that AtDP1/AtDIR12 belongs to the DIR-a subfamily composed of DIRs for 8-8\prime coupling of monolignol radicals. AtDP1/AtDIR12 is specifically expressed in outer integument 1 cells in developing seeds. As a putative oxidase for neolignan biosynthesis, we focused on AtLAC5, a laccase gene coexpressed with AtDP1/AtDIR12. In lac5 mutants, the abundance of feruloylcholine (FC)-conjugated neolignans decreased to a level comparable to those in the atdp1 mutant. In addition, SC/FC-conjugated neolignans were missing in the seeds of mutants defective in SCT/SCPL19, an enzyme that synthesizes SC. These results strongly suggest that AtDP1/AtDIR12 and AtLAC5 are involved in neolignan biosynthesis via SC/FC.

A major controlling quantitative trait locus in rice is qSH1. Although the degree of shattering is correlated with the level of expression of qSH1, some qSH1-defective cultivars display moderate shattering while others show a non-shattering phenotype. Os05 g38120 (SH5) on chromosome 5 is highly homologous to qSH1. Although we detected SH5 transcripts in various organs, this gene was highly expressed at the abscission zone (AZ) in the pedicels. When expression of this gene was suppressed in easy-shattering ’Kasalath’, development of the AZ was reduced and thereby so was seed loss. By contrast, the extent of shattering, as well as AZ development, was greatly enhanced in moderate-shattering ’Dongjin’ rice when SH5 was overexpressed. Likewise, overexpression of SH5 in the non-shattering ’Ilpum’ led to an increase in seed shattering because lignin levels were decreased in the basal region of spikelets in the absence of development of an AZ. We also determined that two shattering-related genes, SHAT1 and Sh4, which are necessary for proper formation of an AZ, were induced by SH5. Based on these observations, we propose that SH5 modulates seed shattering by enhancing AZ development and inhibiting lignin biosynthesis.;,citation_author=Jinmi Yoon;,citation_author=Lae Hyeon Cho;,citation_author=Song Lim Kim;,citation_author=Heebak Choi;,citation_author=Hee Jong Koh;,citation_author=Gynheung An;,citation_publication_date=2014;,citation_cover_date=2014;,citation_year=2014;,citation_issue=5;,citation_doi=10.1111/tpj.12581;,citation_isbn=1365-313X (Electronic) 0960-7412 (Linking);,citation_issn=1365313X;,citation_pmid=24923192;,citation_volume=79;,citation_journal_title=Plant J.;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Roles of lignin biosynthesis and regulatory genes in plant development;,citation_abstract=Lignin is an important factor affecting agricultural traits, biofuel production, and the pulping industry. Most lignin biosynthesis genes and their regulatory genes are expressed mainly in the vascular bundles of stems and leaves, preferentially in tissues undergoing lignification. Other genes are poorly expressed during normal stages of development, but are strongly induced by abiotic or biotic stresses. Some are expressed in non-lignifying tissues such as the shoot apical meristem. Alterations in lignin levels affect plant development. Suppression of lignin biosynthesis genes causes abnormal phenotypes such as collapsed xylem, bending stems, and growth retardation. The loss of expression by genes that function early in the lignin biosynthesis pathway results in more severe developmental phenotypes when compared with plants that have mutations in later genes. Defective lignin deposition is also associated with phenotypes of seed shattering or brittle culm. MYB and NAC transcriptional factors function as switches, and some homeobox proteins negatively control lignin biosynthesis genes.

Grains of indica cultivars turn brown in a phenol solution that accelerates a similar process that occurs during prolonged storage. By contrast, the grains of japonica do not discolor. This distinction may reflect the divergent domestication of these two subspecies. The PHR is controlled by a single gene, Phr1; here, we report the cloning of Phr1, which encodes a polyphenol oxidase. The Phr1 gene is indeed responsible for the PHR phenotype, as transformation with a functional Phr1 can complement a PHR negative cultivar. Phr1 is defective in all japonica lines but functional in nearly all indica and wild strains. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the defects in Phr1 arose independently three times. The multiple recent origins and rapid spread of phr1 in japonica suggest the action of positive selection, which is further supported by several population genetic tests.

A recently introduced timsTOF mass spectrometer (Bruker) couples trapped ion mobility separation to TOF mass analysis. With the parallel accumulation serial fragmentation (PASEF) method, the timsTOF platform achieves promising results, yet analysis of the data generated on this platform represents a major bottleneck. Currently, MaxQuant and PEAKS are most used to analyze these data. However, because of the high complexity of timsTOF PASEF data, both require substantial time to perform even standard tryptic searches. Advanced searches (&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;e.g.</i> with many variable modifications, semi- or non-enzymatic searches, or open searches for post-translational modification discovery) are practically impossible. We have extended our fast peptide identification tool MSFragger to support timsTOF PASEF data, and developed a label-free quantification tool, IonQuant, for fast and accurate 4-D feature extraction and quantification. Using a HeLa data set published by Meier <i>et al.</i> (2018), we demonstrate that MSFragger identifies significantly (\sim30%) more unique peptides than MaxQuant (1.6.10.43), and performs comparably or better than PEAKS X+ (\sim10% more peptides). IonQuant outperforms both in terms of number of quantified proteins while maintaining good quantification precision and accuracy. Runtime tests show that MSFragger and IonQuant can fully process a typical two-hour PASEF run in under 70 min on a typical desktop (6 CPU cores, 32 GB RAM), significantly faster than other tools.

However, our current knowledge of auxin-signaling during wood formation is incomplete. Our previous genome-wide analysis of Aux/IAAs in Eucalyptus grandis showed the presence of the non-canonical paralog member EgrIAA20 that is preferentially expressed in cambium. We analyzed its cellular localization using a GFP fusion protein and its transcriptional activity using transactivation assays, and demonstrated its nuclear localization and strong auxin response repressor activity. In addition, we functionally tested the role of EgrIAA20 by constitutive overexpression in Arabidopsis to investigate for phenotypic changes in secondary xylem formation. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing EgrIAA20 were smaller and displayed impaired development of secondary fibers, but not of other wood cell types. The inhibition in fiber development specifically affected their cell wall lignification. We performed yeast-two-hybrid assays to identify EgrIAA20 protein partners during wood formation in Eucalyptus, and identified EgrIAA9A, whose ortholog PtoIAA9 in poplar is also known to be involved in wood formation.

Along with many biological functions, the ML plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity of plant tissues and organs, as it prevents the cells from separating or sliding against each other. The macromolecular organization and the material properties of the ML are different from those of the adjacent primary cell walls that envelop all plant cells and provide them with a stiff casing. Due to its nanoscale dimensions and the extreme challenge to access the structure for material characterization, the ML is poorly characterized in terms of its distinct material properties. This review explores the ML beyond its functionality as a gluing agent. The putative molecular interactions of constituent macromolecules within the ML and at the interface between ML and primary cell wall are discussed.

Despite its importance and extensive study, the exact theoretical definition of the FSP and the operational definition (the correct way to measure the FSP) are still debated because different methods give a wide range of values. In this paper, a theoretical definition of the FSP is presented based on solution thermodynamics that treats the FSP as a phase boundary. This thermodynamic interpretation allows FSP to be calculated from the chemical potentials of bound and free water as a function of moisture content, assuming that they are both known. Treating FSP as a phase boundary naturally lends itself to the construction of a phase diagram of water in wood. A preliminary phase diagram is constructed with previously published data, and the phase diagram is extended to a state diagram by adding data on the glass transition temperatures of the wood components. The thermodynamic interpretation and resulting state diagram represent a potential framework for understanding how wood modification may affect wood–moisture relations.;,citation_author=Samuel L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Senescence-dependent degradation of Lhcb3 is mediated by a thylakoid membrane-bound protease;,citation_abstract=A novel proteolytic activity integrally associated with barley thylakoid membranes has been discovered and characterized. This enzymatic activity mediates senescence-dependent degradation of Lhcb3, one of the apoproteins of the major light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b protein complex of photosystem II. Once senescence of barley leaves is initiated by detachment and dark incubation, the degradation of Lhcb3 can proceed and be followed in vitro in an experimental system composed of thylakoids isolated from senescing leaves incubated in darkness in suitable medium at 25??C. The protease involved is present in its active form and Lhcb3 is susceptible for proteolytic attack already in fresh leaves, although Lhcb3 degradation does not take place unless undefined extrinsic membrane proteins protecting Lhcb3 are removed in a senescence-dependent manner. It is thus concluded that senescence-dependent Lhcb3 degradation is regulated at the substrate availability level. The protease involved is ATP stimulated, has an optimum activity at pH 7.8, and requires 3 mM added Mg2+ (replicable by micromolar doses of Zn2+) for its proper activity. Studies using typical inhibitors of various classes of proteases indicate that the enzyme is a metalloprotease with disulfide linkage essential for its activity. Micromolar doses of Zn2+ were demonstrated to restore the activity of Lhcb3-degrading enzymes abolished by an ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid pretreatment of the thylakoids and it is inferred that the protease involved is a zinc-binding metalloprotease. Mg 2+ was shown to be able to partially replace zinc as the bound ion. ?? 2004 Elsevier GmbH.

Here transcriptome data sets are obtained from 26 species lacking sequenced genomes, representing each of the five groups: eudicots, monocots, magnoliids, Chloranthaceae and Ceratophyllaceae. Phylogenetic analyses using 59 carefully selected low-copy nuclear genes resulted in highly supported relationships: sisterhood of eudicots and a clade containing Chloranthaceae and Ceratophyllaceae, with magnoliids being the next sister group, followed by monocots. Our topology allows a re-examination of the evolutionary patterns of 110 morphological characters.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=In situ micro-spectroscopic investigation of lignin in poplar cell walls pretreated by maleic acid;,citation_abstract=Lignin is an important phenolic biopolymer that provides strength and rigidity to the secondary cell walls of tracheary elements, sclereids, and fibers in vascular plants. Lignin precursors, called monolignols, are synthesized in the cell and exported to the cell wall where they are polymerized into lignin by oxidative enzymes such as laccases and peroxidases. In Arabidopsis thaliana, a peroxidase (PRX64) and laccase (LAC4) are shown to localize differently within cell wall domains in interfascicular fibers: PRX64 localizes to the middle lamella whereas LAC4 localizes throughout the secondary cell wall layers. Similarly, laccases localized to, and are responsible for, the helical depositions of lignin in protoxylem tracheary elements. In addition, we tested the mobility of laccases in the cell wall using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. mCHERRY-tagged LAC4 was immobile in secondary cell wall domains, but mobile in the primary cell wall when ectopically expressed. A small secreted red fluorescent protein (sec-mCHERRY) was engineered as a control and was found to be mobile in both the primary and secondary cell walls. Unlike sec-mCHERRY, the tight anchoring of LAC4 to secondary cell wall domains indicated that it cannot be remobilized once secreted, and this anchoring underlies the spatial control of lignification.;,citation_author=Yining Zeng;,citation_author=Shuai Zhao;,citation_author=Hui Wei;,citation_author=Melvin P.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=EjAP2-1, an AP2/ERF gene, is a novel regulator of fruit lignification induced by chilling injury, via interaction with EjMYB transcription factors;,citation_abstract=Lignin biosynthesis is regulated by many transcription factors, such as those of the MYB and NAC families. However, the roles of AP2/ERF transcription factors in lignin biosynthesis have been rarely investigated. Eighteen EjAP2/ERF genes were isolated from loquat fruit (Eriobotrya japonica), which undergoes postharvest lignification during low temperature storage. Among these, expression of EjAP2-1, a transcriptional repressor, was negatively correlated with fruit lignification. The dual-luciferase assay indicated that EjAP2-1 could trans-repress activities of promoters of lignin biosynthesis genes from both Arabidopsis and loquat. However, EjAP2-1 did not interact with the target promoters (Ej4CL1). Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays indicated protein-protein interactions between EjAP2-1 and lignin biosynthesis-related EjMYB1 and EjMYB2. Furthermore, repression effects on the Ej4CL1 promoter were observed with the combination of EjAP2-1 and EjMYB1 or EjMYB2, while EjAP2-1 with the EAR motif mutated (mEjAP2-1) lost such repression, although mEjAP2-1 still interacted with EjMYB protein. Based on these results, it is proposed that EjAP2-1 is an indirect transcriptional repressor on lignin biosynthesis, and the repression effects were manifested by EAR motifs and were conducted via protein-protein interaction with EjMYBs. © 2015 Society for Experimental Biology, Association of Applied Biologists and John Wiley &amp;amp;amp; Sons Ltd.;,citation_author=Jiao Zeng;,citation_author=Xian Li;,citation_author=Qian Xu;,citation_author=Jian Chen;,citation_author=Xue Ren Yin;,citation_author=Ian B.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Regulation of loquat fruit low temperature response and lignification involves interaction of heat shock factors and genes associated with lignin biosynthesis;,citation_abstract=Transcriptional regulatory mechanisms underlying lignin metabolism have been widely studied in model plants and woody trees, as well as fruit, such as loquat (Eriobotrya japonica). Unlike the well-known NAC, MYB and AP2/ERF transcription factors, the roles of heat shock factors (HSFs) in lignin regulation have been rarely reported. Two treatments (heat treatment, HT; low temperature conditioning, LTC) were applied to alleviate low temperature-induced lignification in loquat fruit. Gene expression analysis indicated that EjHSF1 transcript abundance, in parallel with heat shock protein genes (EjHsp), was induced by HT, while expression of EjHSF3 was repressed by LTC. Using dual-luciferase assays, EjHSF1 and EjHSF3 trans-activated the promoters of EjHsp genes and lignin biosynthesis-related genes, respectively. Thus, two distinct regulatory mechanisms of EjHSF transcription factors in chilling injury-induced fruit lignification are proposed: EjHSF1 transcriptionally regulated EjHsp genes are involved in chilling tolerance, while EjHSF3 transcriptionally regulated lignin biosynthesis. Furthermore, the relations between EjHSF3 and previously characterized fruit lignification regulators, including EjAP2-1, EjMYB1 and EjMYB2, were also investigated. Yeast-two hybrid (Y2H) and biomolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays demonstrated protein-protein interaction between EjHSF3 and EjAP2-1. Thus, the involvement of EjHSF3 in fruit lignification is via both lignin biosynthetic genes and the regulator, EjAP2-1. This article is protected by copyright.

The resulting products from catechol and gallic acid were polymers that were partially characterized in respect to their optical and thermal properties, and their average molecular weight was estimated via solution viscosity measurements and GPC. FT-IR and 1H-NMR data suggest that phenol monomers are connected with ether or C–C bonds depending on the starting monomer, while the achieved molecular weight of polycatechol is found higher than the corresponding poly(gallic acid).

PAL is regulated at both the transcriptional and translational levels. Our knowledge about the transcriptional regulation of PAL is relatively comprehensive, but our knowledge of the molecular basis of the posttranslational regulation of PAL remains limited. Here, we demonstrate that the Arabidopsis thaliana Kelch repeat F-box (KFB) proteins KFB01, KFB20, and KFB50 physically interact with four PAL isozymes and mediate their proteolytic turnover via the ubiquitination-26S proteasome pathway. The KFB genes are differentially expressed in Arabidopsis tissues and respond to developmental and environmental cues. Up- or downregulation of their expression reciprocally affects the stability of the PAL enzymes, consequently altering the levels of phenylpropanoids. These data suggest that the KFB-mediated protein ubiquitination and degradation regulates the proteolysis of PALs, thus posttranslationally regulating phenylpropanoid metabolism. Characterizing the KFB-mediated proteolysis of PAL enzymes may inform future strategies for manipulating the synthesis of bioactive phenolics.;,citation_author=X. Zhang;,citation_author=M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Fast Vibrational Imaging of Single Cells and Tissues by Stimulated Raman Scattering Microscopy;,citation_abstract=ConspectusTraditionally, molecules are analyzed in a test tube. Taking biochemistry as an example, the majority of our knowledge about cellular content comes from analysis of fixed cells or tissue homogenates using tools such as immunoblotting and liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry. These tools can indicate the presence of molecules but do not provide information on their location or interaction with each other in real time, restricting our understanding of the functions of the molecule under study. For real-time imaging of labeled molecules in live cells, fluorescence microscopy is the tool of choice. Fluorescent labels, however, are too bulky for small molecules such as fatty acids, amino acids, and cholesterol. These challenges highlight a critical need for development of chemical imaging platforms that allow in situ or in vivo analysis of molecules. Vibrational spectroscopy based on spontaneous Raman scattering is widely used for label-free analysis of chemical content in cells and tissues. However, the Raman process is a weak effect, limiting its application for fast chemical imaging of a living system.With high imaging speed and 3D spatial resolution, coherent Raman scattering microscopy is enabling a new approach for real-time vibrational imaging of single cells in a living system. In most experiments, coherent Raman processes involve two excitation fields denoted as pump at \omegap and Stokes at \omegas. When the beating frequency between the pump and Stokes fields (\omegap – \omegas) is resonant with a Raman-active molecular vibration, four major coherent Raman scattering processes occur simultaneously, namely, coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) at (\omegap – \omegas) + \omegap, coherent Stokes Raman scattering (CSRS) at \omegas&nbsp;– (\omegap&nbsp;– \omegas), stimulated Raman gain (SRG) at \omegas, and stimulated Raman loss (SRL) at \omegap. In SRG, the Stokes beam experiences a gain in intensity, whereas in SRL, the pump beam experiences a loss. Both SRG and SRL belong to stimulated Raman scattering (SRS), in which the energy difference between the pump and Stokes fields is transferred to the molecule for vibrational excitation. The SRS signal appears at the same wavelengths as the excitation fields and is commonly extracted through a phase-sensitive detection scheme. The detected intensity change because of a Raman transition is proportional to Im[\chi(3)]IpIs, where \chi(3) represents the third-order nonlinear susceptibility, Ip and Is stand for the intensity of the pump and Stokes fields.In this Account, we discuss the most recent advances in the technical development and enabling applications of SRS microscopy. Compared to CARS, the SRS contrast is free of nonresonant background. Moreover, the SRS intensity is linearly proportional to the density of target molecules in focus. For single-frequency imaging, an SRS microscope offers a speed that is \sim1000 times faster than a line-scan Raman microscope and 10 000 times faster than a point-scan Raman microscope. It is important to emphasize that SRS and spontaneous Raman scattering are complementary to each other. Spontaneous Raman spectroscopy covers the entire window of molecular vibrations, which allows extraction of subtleties via multivariate analysis. SRS offers the speed advantage by focusing on either a single Raman band or a defined spectral window of target molecules. Integrating single-frequency SRS imaging and spontaneous Raman spectroscopy on a single platform allows quantitative compositional analysis of objects inside single live cells.;,citation_author=Delong Zhang;,citation_author=Ping Wang;,citation_author=Mikhail N.

Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) is the first committed enzyme in the pathway, directing primary metabolic flux into a phenylpropanoid branch. Previously, we demonstrated that the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) Kelch domain-containing F-box proteins, AtKFB01, AtKFB20, and AtKFB50, function as the negative regulators controlling phenylpropanoid biosynthesis via mediating PAL’s ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. Here, we reveal that Arabidopsis KFB39, a close homolog of AtKFB50, also interacts physically with PAL isozymes and modulates PAL stability and activity. Disturbing the expression of KFB39 reciprocally affects the accumulation/deposition of a set of phenylpropanoid end products, suggesting that KFB39 is an additional posttranslational regulator responsible for the turnover of PAL and negatively controlling phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. Furthermore, we discover that exposure of Arabidopsis to ultraviolet (UV)-B radiation suppresses the expression of all four KFB genes while inducing the transcription of PAL isogenes; these data suggest that Arabidopsis consolidates both transcriptional and posttranslational regulation mechanisms to maximize its responses to UV light stress. Simultaneous down-regulation of all four identified KFBs significantly enhances the production of (poly)phenols and the plant’s tolerance to UV irradiation.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Reversible Leaf Xylem Collapse: A Potential “Circuit Breaker” against Cavitation;,citation_abstract=We report a novel form of xylem dysfunction in angiosperms: reversible collapse of the xylem conduits of the smallest vein orders that demarcate and intrusively irrigate the areoles of red oak (Quercus rubra) leaves. Cryo-scanning electron microscopy revealed gradual increases in collapse from approximately 22 MPa down to 23 MPa, saturating thereafter (to 24 MPa). Over this range, cavitation remained negligible in these veins. Imaging of rehydration experiments showed spatially variable recovery from collapse within 20 s and complete recovery after 2 min. More broadly, the patterns of deformation induced by desiccation in both mesophyll and xylem suggest that cell wall collapse is unlikely to depend solely on individual wall properties, as mechanical constraints imposed by neighbors appear to be important. From the perspective of equilibrium leaf water potentials, petioles, whose vessels extend into the major veins, showed a vulnerability to cavitation that overlapped in the water potential domain with both minor vein collapse and buckling (turgor loss) of the living cells. However, models of transpiration transients showed that minor vein collapse and mesophyll capacitance could effectively buffer major veins from cavitation over time scales relevant to the rectification of stomatal wrong-way responses. We suggest that, for angiosperms, whose subsidiary cells give up large volumes to allow large stomatal apertures at the cost of potentially large wrong-way responses, vein collapse could make an important contribution to these plants’ ability to transpire near the brink of cavitation-inducing water potentials.;,citation_author=Yong-Jiang Zhang;,citation_author=Fulton E.

The N287C230 TALEN backbone resulted in low mutation rates (0-6.6%), but truncations in its C-terminal domain dramatically increased efficiency to 25%. In most transgenic T0 plants, TALEN produced a single prevalent mutation accompanied by a variety of low-frequency mutations. For each independent T0 plant, the prevalent mutation was present in most tissues within a single tiller as well as in all tillers examined, suggesting that TALEN-induced mutations occurred very early in the development of the shoot apical meristem. Multigenerational analysis showed that TALEN-induced mutations were stably transmitted to the T1 and T2 populations in a normal Mendelian fashion. In our study, the vast majority of TALEN-induced mutations (~81%) affected multiple bases and ~70% of them were deletions.

To understand the mechanism that regulates stem mechanical strength in response to nitrogen, we analysed stem morphology, anatomy, mechanical properties, cell wall components, and expression of cell wall-related genes, in two varieties of japonica rice, namely, Wuyunjing23 (lodging-resistant variety) and W3668 (lodging-susceptible variety). The results showed that higher nitrogen fertilizer increased the lodging index in both varieties due to a reduction in breaking strength and bending stress, and these changes were larger in W3668. Cellulose content decreased slightly under higher nitrogen fertilizer, whereas lignin content reduced remarkably. Histochemical staining revealed that high nitrogen application decreased lignin deposition in the secondary cell wall of the sclerenchyma cells and vascular bundle cells compared with the low nitrogen treatments, while it did not alter the pattern of cellulose deposition in these cells in both Wuyunjing23 and W3668. In addition, the expression of the genes involved in lignin biosynthesis, OsPAL, OsCoMT, Os4CL3, OsCCR, OsCAD2, OsCAD7, OsCesA4, and OsCesA7, were also down-regulated under higher nitrogen conditions at the early stage of culm growth. These results suggest that the genes involved in lignin biosynthesis are down-regulated by higher nitrogen fertilizer, which causes lignin deficiency in the secondary cell walls and the weakening of mechanical tissue structure.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Myosins XI Are Involved in Exocytosis of Cellulose Synthase Complexes;,citation_abstract=In plants, cellulose is synthesized at the cell surface by plasma membrane (PM)-localized cellulose synthase (CESA) complexes (CSCs). The molecular and cellular mechanisms that underpin delivery of CSCs to the PM, however, are poorly understood. Cortical microtubules have been shown to interact with CESA-containing compartments and mark the site for CSC delivery, but are not required for the delivery itself. Here, we demonstrate that myosin XI and the actin cytoskeleton mediate CSC delivery to the PM by coordinating the exocytosis of CESA-containing compartments. Measurement of cellulose content indicated that cellulose biosynthesis was significantly reduced in a myosin xik xi1 xi2 triple-knockout mutant. By combining genetic and pharmacological disruption of myosin activity with quantitative live-cell imaging, we observed decreased abundance of PM-localized CSCs and reduced delivery rate of CSCs in myosin-deficient cells. These phenotypes correlated with a significant increase in failed vesicle secretion events at the PM as well as an abnormal accumulation of CESA-containing compartments at the cell cortex. Through high-resolution spatiotemporal assays of cortical vesicle behavior, we identified defects in CSC vesicle tethering and fusion at the PM. Furthermore, disruption of myosin activity reduced the delivery of several other secretory markers to the PM and reduced constitutive and receptor-mediated endocytosis. These findings reveal a previously undescribed role for myosin in vesicle secretion and cellulose production at the cytoskeleton-PM-cell wall nexus.;,citation_author=Weiwei Zhang;,citation_author=Chao Cai;,citation_author=Christopher J.

To examine these issues without the complexities of living tissues, we treated cell-free strips of onion epidermal walls with various enzymes and other agents to assess which polysaccharides bear mechanical forces in-plane and out-of-plane of the cell wall. This information is critical for integrating concepts of wall structure, wall material properties, tissue mechanics and mechanisms of cell growth. With atomic force microscopy we also monitored real-time changes in the wall surface during treatments. Driselase, a potent cocktail of wall-degrading enzymes, removed cellulose microfibrils in superficial lamellae sequentially, layer-by-layer, and softened the wall (reduced its mechanical stiffness), yet did not induce wall loosening (creep). In contrast Cel12A, a bifunctional xyloglucanase/cellulase, induced creep with only subtle changes in wall appearance. Both Driselase and Cel12A increased the tensile compliance, but differently for elastic and plastic components. Homogalacturonan solubilization by pectate lyase and calcium chelation greatly increased the indentation compliance without changing tensile compliances. Acidic buffer induced rapid cell wall creep via endogenous \alpha-expansins, with negligible effects on wall compliances. We conclude that these various wall properties are not tightly coupled and therefore reflect distinctive aspects of wall structure. Cross-lamellate networks of cellulose microfibrils influenced creep and tensile stiffness whereas homogalacturonan influenced indentation mechanics.

This study aimed to identify the function of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) PRN proteins in lignification of xylem tissues. Chemical composition of the secondary cell walls was analysed in Arabidopsis stems and/or hypocotyls by pyrolysis–gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, 2D-nuclear magnetic resonance and phenolic profiling.

Specifically, myosin XIK GTD bound directly to several exocyst subunits in vitro and functional fluorescently tagged XIK colocalized with multiple exocyst subunits at plasma membrane (PM)-associated stationary foci. Moreover, genetic and pharmacological inhibition of myosin XI activity reduced the rate of appearance and lifetime of stationary exocyst complexes at the PM. By tracking single exocytosis events of cellulose synthase (CESA) complexes with high spatiotemporal resolution imaging and pair-wise colocalization of myosin XIK, exocyst subunits, and CESA6, we demonstrated that XIK associates with secretory vesicles earlier than exocyst and is required for the efficient localization and normal dynamic behavior of exocyst complex at the PM tethering site.

Meanwhile, an increase in the degree of pectin methylesterification was also observed in the seed coat mucilage of AtCESA1T166A mutant. Change in seed development was further reflected by a delayed germination and about 50% increase in the accumulation of proanthocyanidins, which is known to bind pectin and inhibit seed germination as revealed by previous studies.

Deletion of NST1 expression in Medicago truncatula leads to a loss of S lignin associated with a more than 25-fold reduction of F5H expression but only around a 2-fold reduction in expression of other lignin pathway genes. A detailed phylogenetic analysis showed that gymnosperms lack both F5H and orthologs of NST1/SND1. We propose that both F5H and NST1 appeared at a similar time after the divergence of angiosperms and gymnosperms, with F5H possibly originating as a component of a defense mechanism that was recruited to cell wall biosynthesis through the evolution of NST1-binding elements in its promoter.;,citation_author=Qiao Zhao;,citation_author=Huanzhong Wang;,citation_author=Yanbin Yin;,citation_author=Ying Xu;,citation_author=Fang Chen;,citation_author=Richard A.

Lignin biosynthesis is a highly energy-consuming and irreversible process that responds to many developmental and environmental cues, including light, sugar content, circadian clock, plant hormones and wounding. During the past decade, many transcription factors involved in lignin biosynthesis have been identified and characterized.

Lignin is assembled by oxidative polymerization of two major monomers, coniferyl alcohol and sinapyl alcohol. Although two recently discovered laccases, LAC4 and LAC17, have been shown to play a role in lignin polymerization in Arabidopsis thaliana, disruption of both genes only leads to a relatively small change in lignin content and only under continuous illumination. Simultaneous disruption of LAC11 along with LAC4 and LAC17 causes severe plant growth arrest, narrower root diameter, indehiscent anthers, and vascular development arrest with lack of lignification. Genome-wide transcript analysis revealed that all the putative lignin peroxidase genes are expressed at normal levels or even higher in the laccase triple mutant, suggesting that lignin laccase activity is necessary and nonredundant with peroxidase activity for monolignol polymerization during plant vascular development. Interestingly, even though lignin deposition in roots is almost completely abolished in the lac11 lac4 lac17 triple mutant, the Casparian strip, which is lignified through the activity of peroxidase, is still functional.

We have identified Tnt1 retrotransposon insertion mutants of barrel medic (Medicago truncatula) that show reduced lignin autofluorescence under UV microscopy and red coloration in interfascicular fibers. The phenotype is caused by insertion of retrotransposons into a gene annotated as encoding cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase, here designated M. truncatula CAD1. NMR analysis indicated that the lignin is derived almost exclusively from coniferaldehyde and sinapaldehyde and is therefore strikingly different from classical lignins, which are derived mainly from coniferyl and sinapyl alcohols. Despite such a major alteration in lignin structure, the plants appear normal under standard conditions in the greenhouse or growth chamber. However, the plants are dwarfed when grown at 30 ^\circC.

Towards this end, we first designed a combinatory dual-sgRNA/Cas9 vector (construct #1) that successfully deleted miRNA gene regions (MIR169a and MIR827a).

The two constructs were co-transformed into Arabidopsis plants to provide both targeted deletion and donor repair for targeted gene replacement by HDR. Four of 500 stably transformed T0 transgenic plants (0.8%) contained replaced fragments. The presence of the expected recombination sites was further confirmed by sequencing.

Yet overexpression of XND1 blocks differentiation of tracheary elements. The molecular mechanism of XND1 action was investigated. Phylogenetic and motif analyses indicated that XND1 and its homologs are present only in angiosperms and possess a highly conserved C-terminal region containing linear motifs (CKII-acidic, LXCXE, E2FTD-like and LXCXE-mimic) predicted to interact with the cell cycle and differentiation regulator RETINOBLASTOMA-RELATED (RBR). Protein–protein interaction and functional analyses of XND1 deletion mutants were used to test the importance of RBR-interaction motifs. Deletion of either the LXCXE or the LXCXE-mimic motif reduced both the XND1–RBR interaction and XND1 efficacy as a repressor of differentiation, with loss of the LXCXE motif having the strongest negative impacts. The function of the XND1 C-terminal domain could be partially replaced by RBR fused to the N-terminal domain of XND1. XND1 also transactivated gene expression in yeast and plants. The properties of XND1, a transactivator that depends on multiple linear RBR-interaction motifs to inhibit differentiation, have not previously been described for a plant protein.

The fra1 mutation did not cause any defects in cell wall composition, secondary wall thickening, or cortical microtubule organization in fiber cells.

However, all CesA mutants so far reported have been shown to be recessive in terms of cellulose synthesis. In the course of studying the molecular mechanisms regulating secondary wall formation in fibers, we have found that a mutant allele of AtCesA7 gene in the fra5 (fragile fiber 5) mutant causes a semidominant phenotype in the reduction of fiber cell wall thickness and cellulose content. The fra5 missense mutation occurred in a conserved amino acid located in the second cytoplasmic domain of AtCesA7. Overexpression of the fra5 mutant cDNA in wild-type plants not only reduced secondary wall thickness and cellulose content but also decreased primary wall thickness and cell elongation. In contrast, overexpression of the fra6 mutant form of AtCesA8 did not cause any reduction in cell wall thickness and cellulose content.

The expression of 11 SND1-regulated transcription factors, namely, SND2, SND3, MYB103, MYB85, MYB52, MYB54, MYB69, MYB42, MYB43, MYB20, and KNAT7 (a Knotted1-like homeodomain protein), was developmentally associated with cells undergoing secondary wall thickening. Of these, dominant repression of SND2, SND3, MYB103, MYB85, MYB52, MYB54, and KNAT7 significantly reduced secondary wall thickening in fiber cells. Overexpression of SND2, SND3, and MYB103 increased secondary wall thickening in fibers, and overexpression of MYB85 led to ectopic deposition of lignin in epidermal and cortical cells in stems.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Transcriptional regulation of lignin biosynthesis;,citation_abstract=Lignin is the second most abundant plant biopolymer mainly present in the secondary walls of tracheary elements and fibers in wood. Understanding how lignin is biosynthesized has long been an interest to plant biologists and will have a significant impact on tree biotechnology. Lignin is polymerized from monolignols that are synthesized through the lignin biosynthetic pathway. To make lignin, all the genes in the lignin biosynthetic pathway need to be coordinately turned on. It has been shown that a common cis-element, namely the AC element, is present in the majority of the lignin biosynthetic genes and required for their expression in lignifying cells. Important progress has been made in the identification of transcription factors that bind to the AC elements and are potentially involved in the coordinated regulation of lignin biosynthesis. The Arabidopsis MYB58 and MYB63 together with their poplar ortholog PtrMYB28 are transcriptional activators of the lignin biosynthetic pathway, whereas the eucalyptus EgMYB2 and pine PtMYB4 transcription factors are likely Arabidopsis MYB46 orthologs involved in the regulation of the entire secondary wall biosynthetic program. It was found that the transcriptional regulation of lignin biosynthesis is under the control of the same transcriptional network regulating the biosynthesis of other secondary wall components, including cellulose and xylan. The identification of transcription factors directly activating lignin biosynthetic genes provides unprecedented tools to potentially manipulate the amount of lignin in wood and other plants products based on our needs.;,citation_author=Ruiqin Zhong;,citation_author=Zheng-Hua Ye;,citation_publication_date=2009-11;,citation_cover_date=2009-11;,citation_year=2009;,citation_issue=11;,citation_doi=10.4161/psb.4.11.9875;,citation_issn=null;,citation_pmid=19838072;,citation_volume=4;,citation_journal_title=Plant Signaling Behav.;,citation_publisher=Taylor &amp;amp;amp; Francis;">

Here, we report the identification of the transcriptional responsive elements and global analysis of the direct targets of MYB46 and MYB83. Using the estrogen-inducible direct activation system, we found that a number of previously identified MYB46 downstream transcription factors, including MYB43, MYB52, MYB54, MYB58, MYB63 and KNAT7, are direct targets of MYB46. Promoter deletion coupled with transactivation analysis of the MYB63 promoter led to the identification of a 7 bp sequence that is sufficient to be responsive to MYB46 activation, and therefore this sequence is designated as the secondary wall MYB-responsive element (SMRE). Further single nucleotide mutation together with electrophoretic mobility shift assay mapped the SMRE consensus sequence as ACC(A/T)A(A/C)(T/C). Genome-wide analysis of direct targets of MYB46 demonstrated that it directly regulates the expression of not only a number of downstream transcription factors, but also a suite of secondary wall biosynthetic genes, some of which are also directly activated by secondary wall NAC (SWN) master switches or by MYB46 direct targets. Furthermore, MYB83 was found to bind to the same SMRE consensus sequence and activate the same set of direct targets as MYB46. Our study has revealed that the transcription program regulating secondary wall biosynthesis involves a multileveled feed-forward loop regulatory structure in which MYB46/MYB83 together with their regulators SWNs and their direct targets regulate an array of downstream genes thereby activating the secondary wall biosynthetic program.;,citation_author=Ruiqin Zhong;,citation_author=Zheng-Hua Ye;,citation_publication_date=2012-02;,citation_cover_date=2012-02;,citation_year=2012;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1093/pcp/pcr185;,citation_issn=0032-0781;,citation_volume=53;,citation_journal_title=Plant Cell Physiol.;">

Secondary walls provide strength to these cells, which lend mechanical support and protection to the plant body and, in the case of tracheary elements, enable them to function as conduits for transporting water. Formation of secondary walls is a complex process that requires the co-ordinated expression of secondary wall biosynthetic genes, biosynthesis and targeted secretion of secondary wall components, and patterned deposition and assembly of secondary walls. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of genes involved in secondary wall biosynthesis and deposition. Most of the genes involved in the biosynthesis of secondary wall components, including cellulose, xylan, glucomannan and lignin, have been identified and their co-ordinated activation has been shown to be mediated by a transcriptional network encompassing the secondary wall NAC and MYB master switches and their downstream transcription factors. It has been demonstrated that cortical microtubules and microtubule-associated proteins play important roles in the targeted secretion of cellulose synthase complexes, the oriented deposition of cellulose microfibrils and the patterned deposition of secondary walls.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=XND1 Regulates Secondary Wall Deposition in Xylem Vessels through the Inhibition of VND Functions;,citation_abstract=Secondary wall deposition in xylem vessels is activated by Vascular-Related NAC Domain proteins (VNDs) that belong to a group of secondary wall NAC (SWN) transcription factors. By contrast, Xylem NAC Domain1 (XND1) negatively regulates secondary wall deposition in xylem vessels when overexpressed. The mechanism by which XND1 exerts its functions remains elusive. We employed the promoter of the fiber-specific Secondary Wall-Associated NAC Domain1 (SND1) gene to ectopically express XND1 in fiber cells to investigate its mechanism of action on secondary wall deposition. Ectopic expression of XND1 in fiber cells severely diminished their secondary wall deposition and drastically reduced the expression of SWN-regulated downstream transcription factors and secondary wall biosynthetic genes but not that of the SWN genes themselves. Transactivation analyses revealed that XND1 specifically inhibited SWN-activated expression of these downstream genes but not their MYB46-activated expression. Both the NAC domain and the C-terminus of XND1 were required for its inhibitory function and its NAC domain interacted with the DNA-binding domains of SWNs. XND1 was shown to be localized in the cytoplasm and the nucleus and its co-expression with VND6 resulted in the cytoplasmic sequestration of VND6. Furthermore, the C-terminus of XND1 was indispensable for the XND1-mediated cytoplasmic retention of VND6 and its fusion to VND6 was able to direct VND6 to the cytoplasm and render it unable to activate the gene expression. Since the XND1 gene is specifically expressed in xylem cells, these results indicate that XND1 acts through inhibiting VND functions to negatively regulate secondary wall deposition in xylem vessels.;,citation_author=Ruiqin Zhong;,citation_author=Muthugapatti K Kandasamy;,citation_author=Zheng-Hua Ye;,citation_publication_date=2021-01;,citation_cover_date=2021-01;,citation_year=2021;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1093/pcp/pcaa140;,citation_issn=1471-9053;,citation_volume=62;,citation_journal_title=Plant Cell Physiol.;">

The ability to chemically differentiate and spatially locate lignins in wood cell structures provides an important contribution to the effort to improve these processes. The spatial distribution of the syringyl (S) and guaiacyl (G) lignins, both over larger regions and within a single cell wall, on poplar ( Populus trichocarpa ) wood cross-sections was determined via time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). This is the first time that direct chemically specific mass spectrometric mapping has been employed to elucidate the spatial distribution of S and G lignins. In agreement with results obtained by UV microscopy, ToF-SIMS images clearly show that the guaiacyl lignin is predominantly located in the vessel cell walls of poplar wood while syringyl lignin is mainly located in the fiber cell walls. The G/S ratio in vessel cell walls was determined to be approximately twice that found in fiber cell walls. A combination of Bi ToF-SIMS spectral image acquisition and C(60) sputtering provided the ability to attain the combination of spatial resolution and signal-to-noise necessary to determine the distribution of S and G lignins in a single cell wall.

These properties indicate that laccases may be involved in the formation of important medicinal phenolic acid compounds in Salvia miltiorrhiza such as salvianolic acid B (SAB), which is used for cardiovascular disease treatment. To date, 29 laccases have been found in S. miltiorrhiza (SmLACs), and some of which (SmLAC7 and SmLAC20) have been reported to influence the synthesis of phenolic acids. Because of the functional redundancy of laccase genes, their roles in S. miltiorrhiza are poorly understood. In this study, the CRISPR/Cas9 system was used for targeting conserved domains to knockout multiple genes of laccase family in S. miltiorrhiza. The expressions of target laccase genes as well as the phenolic acid biosynthesis key genes decrease dramatically in editing lines. Additionally, the growth and development of hairy roots was significantly retarded in the gene-edited lines. The cross-sections examination of laccase mutant hairy roots showed that the root development was abnormal and the xylem cells in the edited lines became larger and looser than those in the wild type. Additionally, the accumulation of RA as well as SAB was decreased, and the lignin content was nearly undetectable. It suggested that SmLACs play key roles in development and lignin formation in the root of S. miltiorrhiza and they are necessary for phenolic acids biosynthesis.;,citation_author=Zheng Zhou;,citation_author=Qing Li;,citation_author=Liang Xiao;,citation_author=Yun Wang;,citation_author=Jingxian Feng;,citation_author=Qitao Bu;,citation_author=Ying Xiao;,citation_author=Kai Hao;,citation_author=Meili Guo;,citation_author=Wansheng Chen;,citation_author=Lei Zhang;,citation_publication_date=2021;,citation_cover_date=2021;,citation_year=2021;,citation_doi=10.3389/fpls.2021.647768;,citation_issn=1664-462X;,citation_volume=12;,citation_journal_title=Front.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Fragile Fiber1 Kinesin Contributes to Cortical Microtubule-Mediated Trafficking of Cell Wall Components;,citation_abstract=The cell wall consists of cellulose microfibrils embedded within a matrix of hemicellulose and pectin.

The trafficking of vesicles containing cell wall components is thought to depend on actin-myosin. Here, we implicate microtubules in this process through studies of the kinesin-4 family member, Fragile Fiber1 (FRA1). In an fra1-5 knockout mutant, the expansion rate of the inflorescence stem is halved compared with the wild type along with the thickness of both primary and secondary cell walls. Nevertheless, cell walls in fra1-5 have an essentially unaltered composition and ultrastructure. A functional triple green fluorescent protein-tagged FRA1 fusion protein moves processively along cortical microtubules, and its abundance and motile density correlate with growth rate. Motility of FRA1 and cellulose synthase complexes is independent, indicating that FRA1 is not directly involved in cellulose biosynthesis; however, the secretion rate of fucose-alkyne-labeled pectin is greatly decreased in fra1-5, and the mutant has Golgi bodies with fewer cisternae and enlarged vesicles. Based on our results, we propose that FRA1 contributes to cell wall production by transporting Golgi-derived vesicles along cortical microtubules for secretion.;,citation_author=Chuanmei Zhu;,citation_author=Anindya Ganguly;,citation_author=Tobias I.

We found that RALF1 promotes FERONIA-mediated phosphorylation of eIF4E1, a eukaryotic translation initiation factor that plays a crucial role in the control of mRNA translation rate. Phosphorylated eIF4E1 increases mRNA affinity and modulates mRNA translation and, thus, protein synthesis. The mRNAs targeted by the RALF1–FERONIA–eIF4E1 module include ROP2 and RSL4, which are important regulators of RH cell polarity and growth.

Precise localization of the spatiotemporal deposition of lignin is of great importance for revealing the lignification regulatory mechanism of individual cells. In loquat fruits, lignification typically increases the flesh lignin content and firmness, reducing their edibility and processing quality. However, the precise localization of the spatiotemporal active zones of lignification inside loquat fruit flesh remains poorly understood, and little is known about the contribution of patterned lignification to cell wall structure dynamics and the subsequent fruit-quality deterioration. Here, we performed an emerging bioorthogonal chemistry imaging technique to trace the in vivo patterned lignification dynamics in cells of loquat fruit flesh during development and storage. In developing fruits, lignified cells (LCs) and vascular bundles (VBs) were the zones of active lignification, and ring-like LCs deposited lignin at both the inner wall layer and the outer periphery sides. The domino effect of the generation of LCs was preliminarily visualized. In mature fruits, the newly formed lignin in the flesh of fruits during storage was specifically deposited in the corners and middle lamellae of parenchyma cells surrounding the VBs, resulting in the development of a reticular structure. Based on the findings, distinct spatiotemporal patterned lignification modes for different flesh cells in loquat fruits were proposed.

These data imply that CESA activity is regulated by trafficking to the plasma membrane (exocytosis) and removal from the plasma membrane (endocytosis), as well as recycling of endocytosed CESAs back to the plasma membrane. Key molecular components and events of CESA exocytosis and endocytosis have recently been defined, primarily using mutant analysis and live-cell imaging in Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, we integrate these data into a working model of CESA regulation by exocytosis and endocytosis and highlight key outstanding questions.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Altering the laccase functionality by in vivo assembly of mutant libraries with different mutational spectra;,citation_abstract=The generation of diversity for directed protein evolution experiments shows an important bottleneck in the in vitro random mutagenesis protocols. Most of them are biased towards specific changes that eventually confer a predicted and conservative mutational spectrum, limiting the exploration of the vast protein space. The current work describes a simple methodology to in vivo recombine mutant libraries with different nucleotide bias created by in vitro methods. This in vivo assembly was based on the accurate physiology of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which as host, provided its high homologous recombination frequency to shuffle the libraries in a nonmutagenic way. The fungal thermophilic laccase from Myceliophthora thermophila expressed in S. cerevisiae was submitted to this protocol under the selective pressure of high concentrations of organic solvents. Mutant 2E9 with approximately 3-fold better kinetics than parent type showed two consecutive amino acid changes (G614D -GGC/GAC- and E615K -GAG/AAG-) because of the in vivo shuffling of the mutant libraries. Both mutations are located in the C-terminal tail that is specifically processed at the Golgi during the maturation of the protein by the Kex2 protease. Notoriously, the oxygen consumption at the T2/T3 trinuclear copper cluster was altered and the catalytic copper at the T1 site was perturbed showing differences in its redox potential and geometry. The change in the isoelectric point of C-terminal extension upon mutations seems to affect the folding of the protein at the posttranslational processing steps providing new insights in the significance of the C-terminal tail for the functionality of the ascomycete laccases.;,citation_author=Miren Zumárraga;,citation_author=Susana Camarero;,citation_author=Sergey Shleev;,citation_author=Arturo Martínez-Arias;,citation_author=Antonio Ballesteros;,citation_author=Francisco J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=KORRIGAN, an Arabidopsis Endo-1,4-\beta-Glucanase, Localizes to the Cell Plate by Polarized Targeting and Is Essential for Cytokinesis;,citation_abstract=The formation of the cell plate, a unique structure in dividing plant cells, is pivotal for cytokinesis. A mutation in the Arabidopsis KORRIGAN (KOR) gene causes the formation of aberrant cell plates, incomplete cell walls, and multinucleated cells, leading to severely abnormal seedling morphology. The mutant, designed kor1-2, was identified as a stronger allele than the previously identified kor1-1, which appears to be defective only in cell elongation. KOR1 encodes an endo-1,4-\beta-d-glucanase with a transmembrane domain and two putative polarized targeting signals in the cytosolic tail. When expressed in tobacco BY2 cells, a KOR1-GFP (green fluorescence protein) fusion protein was localized to growing cell plates. Substitution mutations in the polarized targeting motifs of KOR1 caused the fusion proteins to localize to the plasma membrane as well. Expression of these mutant genes in kor1-2 plants complemented only the cell elongation defect but not the cytokinesis defect, indicating that polarized targeting of KOR1 to forming cell plates is essential for cytokinesis. Our results suggest that KOR1 plays a critical role during cytokinesis.;,citation_author=Jianru Zuo;,citation_author=Qi-Wen Niu;,citation_author=Naoko Nishizawa;,citation_author=Yan Wu;,citation_author=Benedikt Kost;,citation_author=Nam-Hai Chua;,citation_publication_date=2000-07;,citation_cover_date=2000-07;,citation_year=2000;,citation_issue=7;,citation_doi=10.1105/tpc.12.7.1137;,citation_issn=1040-4651;,citation_volume=12;,citation_journal_title=Plant Cell;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Sorting signals, N-terminal modifications and abundance of the chloroplast proteome;,citation_abstract=Characterization of the chloroplast proteome is needed to understand the essential contribution of the chloroplast to plant growth and development. Here we present a large scale analysis by nanoLC-Q-TOF and nanoLC-LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometry (MS) of ten independent chloroplast preparations from Arabidopsis thaliana which unambiguously identified 1325 proteins. Novel proteins include various kinases and putative nucleotide binding proteins. Based on repeated and independent MS based protein identifications requiring multiple matched peptide sequences, as well as literature, 916 nuclear-encoded proteins were assigned with high confidence to the plastid, of which 86% had a predicted chloroplast transit peptide (cTP). The protein abundance of soluble stromal proteins was calculated from normalized spectral counts from LTQ-Obitrap analysis and was found to cover four orders of magnitude. Comparison to gel-based quantification demonstrates that ’spectral counting’ can provide large scale protein quantification for Arabidopsis. This quantitative information was used to determine possible biases for protein targeting prediction by TargetP and also to understand the significance of protein contaminants. The abundance data for 550 stromal proteins was used to understand abundance of metabolic pathways and chloroplast processes. We highlight the abundance of 48 stromal proteins involved in post-translational proteome homeostasis (including aminopeptidases, proteases, deformylases, chaperones, protein sorting components) and discuss the biological implications. N-terminal modifications were identified for a subset of nuclear- and chloroplast-encoded proteins and a novel N-terminal acetylation motif was discovered. Analysis of cTPs and their cleavage sites of Arabidopsis chloroplast proteins, as well as their predicted rice homologues, identified new species-dependent features, which will facilitate improved subcellular localization prediction. No evidence was found for suggested targeting via the secretory system. This study provides the most comprehensive chloroplast proteome analysis to date and an expanded Plant Proteome Database (PPDB) in which all MS data are projected on identified gene models.;,citation_author=Boris Zybailov;,citation_author=Heidi Rutschow;,citation_author=Giulia Friso;,citation_author=Andrea Rudella;,citation_author=Olof Emanuelsson;,citation_author=Qi Sun;,citation_author=Klaas J.

        <p>Lignins are a key adaptation enabling vascular plants to thrive in terrestrial habitats. Lignin is heterogeneous – containing upwards of 30 different monomers – and its function multifarious: It provides structural support, predetermined breaking points, UV-protection, diffusion barriers, pathogen resistance and drought resilience. Recent studies, carefully characterising lignin <em>in situ,</em> have started to identify specific lignin compositions and ultrastructures with distinct cellular functions, but our understanding remains fractional. We summarise recent works and highlight where further <em>in situ</em> lignin analysis could provide valuable insights into plant growth and adaptation. We also summarise strengths and weaknesses of lignin <em>in situ</em> analysis methods.</p>

<p><em>Lignin is the second-most abundant biopolymer on earth.</em> This oft-repeated phrase urges us to understand the importance of this complex phenolic polymer as a function of the sheer quantities present in our biosphere. It is a very compelling framing, considering the enormous potential of lignin as carbon sink and industrial resource from ecological and economical perspectives respectively. From a physiological point-of-view, however, focusing only on the abundance of lignin – or more precisely <em>lignins,</em> as we are referring to various, chemically distinct polymers – risks overlooking its impressive versatility with respect to cellular function. Tightly delineated deposition of lignins, adapted in timing and composition to various cell types and cell wall layers, is paramount for healthy plant growth — and their efficient use by us.

<p>Lignins are formed by all vascular plants and in all plant organs. They accumulate in the cell wall, a semi-crystalline composite of mainly polysaccharides – cellulose, hemicelluloses and pectins – surrounding the protoplast of each plant cell.<span class="citation" data-cites="Pedersen2023"><sup><a href="#ref-Pedersen2023" role="doc-biblioref">23</a></sup></span> Where exactly these lignins accumulate, however, is controlled with nanometre precision (<a href="#tbl-locations" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;1</a>). Fundamentally, lignification requires two components: Oxidative enzymes and monomers. Laccases (LACs) and peroxidases (PRXs) – resilient, glycosylated phenoloxidases – are responsible for lignin polymerization.<span class="citation" data-cites="Blaschek2021"><sup><a href="#ref-Blaschek2021" role="doc-biblioref">24</a></sup></span> In lignifying primary and secondary cell walls (PCWs and SCWs), LACs and PRXs are expressed concomitantly with the enzymes responsible for biosynthesis of cellulose and other cell wall polysaccharides.<span class="citation" data-cites="Blaschek2023"><sup><a href="#ref-Blaschek2023" role="doc-biblioref">20</a></sup></span> In contrast to cellulose synthases or glucosyltransferases involved in hemicellulose formation, LACs and PRXs are exported into the apoplast, where they are embedded into the forming cell wall. Both types of enzymes play important roles — LACs are indispensable for xylem lignification, while Casparian strip integrity depends on PRXs.<span class="citation" data-cites="Blaschek2021 Blaschek2023 Rojas-Murcia2020"><sup><a href="#ref-Blaschek2023" role="doc-biblioref">20</a>,<a href="#ref-Blaschek2021" role="doc-biblioref">24</a>,<a href="#ref-Rojas-Murcia2020" role="doc-biblioref">25</a></sup></span> Paralogs of both enzyme groups are immobilized in different cell types and cell wall layers, enabling specific functions.<span class="citation" data-cites="Hoffmann2020 Blaschek2023"><sup><a href="#ref-Blaschek2023" role="doc-biblioref">20</a>,<a href="#ref-Hoffmann2020" role="doc-biblioref">26</a></sup></span> Lignin monomers are a large group of phenolic compounds recently summarized with great insight by John Ralph and colleagues.<span class="citation" data-cites="Ralph2023"><sup><a href="#ref-Ralph2023" role="doc-biblioref">27</a></sup></span> Most common and abundant are phenylpropanoids with different ring substitutions, for example 4-hydroxyphenyl (H) units with a 4-hydroxyl, guaiacyl (G) units with an additional 3-methoxy and syringyl (S) units with a further 5-methoxy. In addition to their ring structures, these phenylpropanoid monomers also vary in their aliphatic functional group, usually exhibiting an alcohol (CHOH) or aldehyde (CHO). At the onset of cell wall lignification, lignin monomers are exported from the cytosol into the cell wall. How exactly this transport is catalyzed is also still contentious, with recent evidence favoring a diffusion-based mechanism.<span class="citation" data-cites="Perkins2022"><sup><a href="#ref-Perkins2022" role="doc-biblioref">28</a></sup></span> Here, we should also note that it is not yet clear in which form lignin monomers are exported and polymerized — it might include unconjugated, glycosylated or esterified phenolics. In the cell wall, lignin monomers undergo 1-electron oxidation by LACs or PRXs, respectively using O<sub>2</sub> or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as electron acceptor. The resulting radicals – stabilised by mesomeric resonance forms – react either with each other to form dimers or extend a growing polymer.<span class="citation" data-cites="Ralph2023"><sup><a href="#ref-Ralph2023" role="doc-biblioref">27</a></sup></span> Depending on the involved monomers and reaction environments, lignin polymerization generates a variety of different –C–O–C and –C–C– bonds resulting in structurally and compositionally diverse polymers.<span class="citation" data-cites="Ralph2023"><sup><a href="#ref-Ralph2023" role="doc-biblioref">27</a></sup></span> In the xylem, these steps occur continuously and cell–cell cooperatively. Newly developing tracheary elements – the conduits of hydromineral sap – undergo programmed cell death before they lignify. The monomers for their “post-mortem” lignification are supplied by adjacent, still living tracheary elements or (ray) parenchyma cells, or over longer distances through the xylem sap.<span class="citation" data-cites="Pesquet2013 DeMeester2021 Zhang2020a"><sup><a href="#ref-Pesquet2013" role="doc-biblioref">29</a>–<a href="#ref-Zhang2020a" role="doc-biblioref">31</a></sup></span> This enables tracheary elements, and to a lesser extent fibers, to continue adjusting their biomechanical and biophysical characteristics long after they died.<span class="citation" data-cites="Menard2022"><sup><a href="#ref-Menard2022" role="doc-biblioref">19</a></sup></span> The resulting lignin composition is partly a result of the monomers available during polymerization.<span class="citation" data-cites="Ralph2023"><sup><a href="#ref-Ralph2023" role="doc-biblioref">27</a></sup></span> Additionally, variations in substrate specificity between LAC paralogs fine-tune lignin biochemistry on the nanoscale.<span class="citation" data-cites="Blaschek2023 Zhuo2022"><sup><a href="#ref-Zhuo2022" role="doc-biblioref">17</a>,<a href="#ref-Blaschek2023" role="doc-biblioref">20</a></sup></span> Lastly, dirigent proteins can direct lignification to favor specific stereochemistries.<span class="citation" data-cites="Gao2023"><sup><a href="#ref-Gao2023" role="doc-biblioref">32</a></sup></span> Together, these processes lead to a highly heterogeneous distribution of specific lignins, which is largely conserved among vascular plants. Angiosperm fibres, for example, have a higher S/G ratio and lower G<sub>CHO</sub>/G<sub>CHOH</sub> ratio than tracheary elements.<span class="citation" data-cites="Menard2022"><sup><a href="#ref-Menard2022" role="doc-biblioref">19</a></sup></span> For cell types outside of the xylem, this type of lignin composition data is still exceedingly rare, although some tendencies can be extracted from the literature (<a href="#tbl-locations" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;1</a>).</p>
<p>Within cell walls, lignins fill out the spaces between cell wall polysaccharides. Lignins interact non-covalently with both hemicelluloses and cellulose,<span class="citation" data-cites="Kirui2022"><sup><a href="#ref-Kirui2022" role="doc-biblioref">33</a></sup></span> and even form covalent crosslinks with hemicelluloses and potentially pectins.<span class="citation" data-cites="Giummarella2019"><sup><a href="#ref-Giummarella2019" role="doc-biblioref">34</a></sup></span> By reducing the water-accessible surface areas of cell wall polysaccharides, lignins set the cell wall hydration capacity and enable it to retain a quasi-constant volume irrespective of the surrounding water availability.<span class="citation" data-cites="Blaschek2023"><sup><a href="#ref-Blaschek2023" role="doc-biblioref">20</a></sup></span> The prevalence and effects of these interactions are distinct depending on species, cell type and lignin biochemistry.<span class="citation" data-cites="Kirui2022"><sup><a href="#ref-Kirui2022" role="doc-biblioref">33</a></sup></span> The cross-linking and “curing” of cell walls by such interactions is likely a significant aspect of lignin’s various functions. To what extent the monomeric composition and degree of cross-linking differs between cell types responsible for water conduction and lateral distribution (tracheary elements), biomechanical support (fibres), diffusion barriers (endo-/exodermis), or pathogen defense (stress lignin), is only beginning to be understood (<a href="#tbl-locations" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;1</a>).</p>

<p>Analyses of fossil and extant plant sample collections reaching back to the Devonian have been instrumental in showing the importance of the spatial control of lignin accumulation for vascular plant evolution. Around 410 million years ago, terrestrial bryophytes had developed the initial blueprints of the tracheary element prototype: the hydroids – cells forming water conducting tubes by undergoing programmed cell death. Compared with water transport through plasmodesmata, the development of hydroids improved water transport by more than 6-fold.<span class="citation" data-cites="Sperry2003"><sup><a href="#ref-Sperry2003" role="doc-biblioref">36</a></sup></span> In some moss genera such as <em>Sphagnum,</em> hydroid lateral cell walls are reinforced by patterned SCWs to combine lateral porosity in the gaps with mechanical reinforcement in rib-like, lignin-free thickenings.<span class="citation" data-cites="Ligrone2000"><sup><a href="#ref-Ligrone2000" role="doc-biblioref">37</a></sup></span> Bryophytes are devoid of lignins, but form other phenolic polymers like melanins and coumaroyl-ester polymers in cuticles.<span class="citation" data-cites="Renault2017"><sup><a href="#ref-Renault2017" role="doc-biblioref">38</a></sup></span> The evolutionary outburst of the Devonian saw the emergence of tracheary elements. They proved considerably more efficient than hydroids due to the addition of perforations for improved sap flow and lignified SCWs for better mechanical support.<span class="citation" data-cites="Sperry2003"><sup><a href="#ref-Sperry2003" role="doc-biblioref">36</a></sup></span> This evolutionary enhancement in pro-vascular plants, such as observed in fossils of <em>Aglaophyton</em> and <em>Hornephyton</em>, started with the formation of micropores onto the pro-tracheary element sidewalls impregnated with lignin-like polymers (<a href="#fig-evolution" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;1</a>).<span class="citation" data-cites="Ligrone2000"><sup><a href="#ref-Ligrone2000" role="doc-biblioref">37</a></sup></span> Next, both the layering and patterning of cell wall depositions changed, with the first occurrence of banded/spiral SCW patterns in rhynopsid fossils and named after <em>Sennicaulis</em> (S-type pattern), resembling modern protoxylem tracheary elements.<span class="citation" data-cites="Edwards2003"><sup><a href="#ref-Edwards2003" role="doc-biblioref">35</a></sup></span> However, in contrast to modern cells, the accumulation of lignin-like polymers in S-type tracheary elements is uniformly covering the SCW luminal surface.<span class="citation" data-cites="Edwards2003"><sup><a href="#ref-Edwards2003" role="doc-biblioref">35</a></sup></span> This was followed by the emergence of <em>Gosslingia</em> (G-type) SCW patterns in lycophytes, maintaining the banded/spiral motives but with larger micropores present in the gaps; lignin-like polymers were still only present in a surface layer towards the cell lumen.<span class="citation" data-cites="Edwards2003"><sup><a href="#ref-Edwards2003" role="doc-biblioref">35</a></sup></span> S- and G-type lignin-like polymers are considered the ancestral origin of lignins for all vascular plants. Progressing through the Devonian, SCW pattern also diversified to resemble modern metaxylem tracheary elements with reticulate/pitted motives such as observed in <em>Psilophyton</em> (P-type) tracheary elements that developed pits interspersed in SCWs with a less uniform lignin-like surface coverage depending on the cell wall thickness.<span class="citation" data-cites="Edwards2003"><sup><a href="#ref-Edwards2003" role="doc-biblioref">35</a></sup></span> Further evolutionary refinement first enabled tracheary elements in gymnosperms to fully impregnate all cell wall layers with lignin. Already then, lignin chemistry was specifically delineated between cell wall layers, such as in the torus margo of its lateral pits.<span class="citation" data-cites="Schulte2021"><sup><a href="#ref-Schulte2021" role="doc-biblioref">39</a></sup></span> Modern vessels with larger diameter and perforation plates at the end-walls of tracheary elements appeared by the mid-Cretaceous such as in fossils of Gigantopteridales.<span class="citation" data-cites="Sperry2003"><sup><a href="#ref-Sperry2003" role="doc-biblioref">36</a></sup></span> These modern vessels included a variation in SCW pattern together with lignin accumulation restricted to its thickenings and absent from the gaps (<a href="#fig-evolution" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;1</a>). Fiber cell types, with all their variation from tracheiform to libriform fibers,<span class="citation" data-cites="Sperry2003"><sup><a href="#ref-Sperry2003" role="doc-biblioref">36</a></sup></span> derived from tracheary elements by reducing the density of SCW gaps in their sidewalls, increasing cell wall polysaccharide amounts but also differently controlling both lignin amount and chemistry. Both fiber cell types – together with the characteristically high ratio and S- to G-units in their lignin – have been suggested to have convergently evolved several times, <em>e.g</em> in angiosperms and specific species of lycophytes such as <em>Selaginella.</em><span class="citation" data-cites="Jin2007"><sup><a href="#ref-Jin2007" role="doc-biblioref">40</a></sup></span> The evolution of enzyme paralogs and their neofunctionalisation have been key to the diversification of lignin chemistry. To acquire S lignins, angiosperms duplicated cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase genes into at least two paralogs (cinnamate 4-hydroxylase and ferulate 5-hydroxylase in Arabidopsis), whereas the lycophyte <em>Selaginella</em> extended the substrate range of its only cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase to catalyze both reactions.<span class="citation" data-cites="Weng2010"><sup><a href="#ref-Weng2010" role="doc-biblioref">41</a></sup></span> Although lignin spatial chemistry and content is mainly conserved between homologous cell types in vascular plant species, further adaptive changes in lignin spatial distribution occurred during speciation. These include a gradual reduction of the lignin ratio between PCWs and SCWs in tracheary elements of gymnosperms and angiosperms compared to ferns and lycophytes.<span class="citation" data-cites="Boyce2004"><sup><a href="#ref-Boyce2004" role="doc-biblioref">22</a></sup></span> Extreme cases include the absence of lignin from PCWs of xylem cells in eastern leatherwood <em>Dirca palustris,</em><span class="citation" data-cites="Mottiar2020"><sup><a href="#ref-Mottiar2020" role="doc-biblioref">21</a></sup></span> or even a complete absence of lignin in all cell wall layers of tracheary elements in the monocotyledon eelgrass <em>Zostera marina.</em><span class="citation" data-cites="Pfeifer2022"><sup><a href="#ref-Pfeifer2022" role="doc-biblioref">42</a></sup></span> As with monomer biosynthesis, such tight spatial regulation of lignin polymerization is partly driven by gene duplication and reduction. The number of LAC paralogs ranges from 11 to 70 (0.039–0.192% of all genes) in terrestrial plants compared to only 3 to 7 (0.015–0.036%) in aquatic angiosperms.<span class="citation" data-cites="Blaschek2021 Simoes2020"><sup><a href="#ref-Blaschek2021" role="doc-biblioref">24</a>,<a href="#ref-Simoes2020" role="doc-biblioref">43</a></sup></span> Once accumulated, lignin deposits cannot be removed by the plant. The timing of specific spatial accumulation of lignin is therefore carefully regulated and conserved between species: in tracheary elements of both gymnosperms and angiosperms, lignin varying in chemistry and amounts are progressively accumulated from the most external to the most internal cell wall layers. Environmental constraints also affect the spatial distribution of lignin in both in quantity and composition. Gravitropic stress in gymnosperms, for example, leads to the cell wall layer-specific over-accumulation of H-rich lignins,<span class="citation" data-cites="Hiraide2021"><sup><a href="#ref-Hiraide2021" role="doc-biblioref">7</a></sup></span> while biotic stresses in angiosperms trigger accumulation of S-rich lignins (<a href="#tbl-locations" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;1</a>). Lignin spatial distribution has thus been extensively selected during plant evolution and speciation to enable specific cell wall layers and cell types to change quantities and chemistries of accumulated lignin to best adjust to developmental and environmental constraints.</p>

<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, considering the evolutionary success and physiological importance of lignins, efforts to generate plants with cell walls more amenable to industrial exploitation by reducing lignin amount or changing its composition usually result in stunted growth phenotypes.<span class="citation" data-cites="DeMeester2018 DeMeester2020 Menard2022 Sulis2023"><sup><a href="#ref-Menard2022" role="doc-biblioref">19</a>,<a href="#ref-DeMeester2018" role="doc-biblioref">44</a>–<a href="#ref-Sulis2023" role="doc-biblioref">46</a></sup></span> Despite this common observation, overall lignin content in stems of poplar (<em>Populus</em> spp.; <a href="#fig-correlation" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;2</a> A) and Arabidopsis (<a href="#fig-correlation" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;2</a> B) poorly predicts plant growth. Indeed, we can understand the importance of lignin only when considering it in its cellular context — specifically in tracheary elements. There, compromised lignification leads to weakened SCWs that collapse inwards under the negative pressure driving sap transport – known as an <em>irregular xylem</em> (<em>irx</em>) phenotype. This phenotype leads to impaired sap transport, limiting vertical plant growth together with the biomechanical weakening of the stem. Underlining the importance of this particular lignin function, tracheary element-specific lignin concentration explains more than half of the observed variation in plant height (<a href="#fig-correlation" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;2</a> C). Beside crude concentration, both S/G and G<sub>CHO</sub>/G<sub>CHOH</sub> ratios have decisive effects on cell wall biomechanics and <em>irx</em>,<span class="citation" data-cites="Menard2022"><sup><a href="#ref-Menard2022" role="doc-biblioref">19</a></sup></span> as do other cell wall polymers. The extent of <em>irx</em> explains almost 90% of impaired plant growth in greenhouse conditions (<a href="#fig-correlation" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;2</a> D). Indeed, restoring full lignification only in tracheary elements of hypolignified, dwarfed Arabidopsis and poplar mutants conferred wild type-like growth — even though total lignin levels in the stems remained reduced.<span class="citation" data-cites="DeMeester2018 DeMeester2021"><sup><a href="#ref-DeMeester2021" role="doc-biblioref">30</a>,<a href="#ref-DeMeester2018" role="doc-biblioref">44</a></sup></span> Such genetic complementation restrictively in tracheary elements confirms that all lignin in all cell types does not have the same impact on plant growth. The importance of fibres and their lignified SCWs for plant growth and mechanics might well be larger than this data set suggests — especially under field conditions. To conclusively disentangle the functional importances of these closely linked cell types and their distinct lignins, we need carefully planned experiments linking <em>in situ</em> lignin quantification with plant growth in a comprehensive set of species and mutants.</p>
<p>The biomechanics of whole stems – including <em>e.g</em> the flexibility conferred by higher CHO/CHOH ratios – can be extrapolated reasonably well from single cells.<span class="citation" data-cites="Menard2022"><sup><a href="#ref-Menard2022" role="doc-biblioref">19</a></sup></span> To some extent, however, tissue biomechanics are an emergent property arising from the interplay between cell types and cell wall layers with contrasting characteristics. The perhaps most compelling example of this is the xylem of the eastern leatherwood mentioned above, which has been suggested to owe its eponymous flexibility to the formation of lignified SCWs interfacing with each other through lignin-free, flexible PCWs.<span class="citation" data-cites="Mottiar2020"><sup><a href="#ref-Mottiar2020" role="doc-biblioref">21</a></sup></span> To understand these interaction effects in biochemistry and function of lignins, we first need reliable data with (sub-)cellular resolution.</p>

<p>The complexity of lignin makes its biochemical analysis challenging. Lignin monomeric composition is so diverse, and its association with other cell wall polymers and hydrophobic extractives so tight, that measuring <em>all</em> lignins and <em>only</em> lignins in a sample is near impossible. Most traditionally used lignin analysis methods – Klason, acetyl bromide and thioglycolic acid assays among many others – proceed via sample milling and extraction to purify the majority of lignin. While these methods estimate lignin concentration reasonably well, they all have extensively debated biases<span class="citation" data-cites="Hatfield2005"><sup><a href="#ref-Hatfield2005" role="doc-biblioref">47</a></sup></span> and, crucially, cannot provide detailed information about the cellular distribution of lignin. The latter limitation can be mitigated, but not avoided, by meticulous sampling by <em>e.g.</em> laser micro dissection. The alternative to extract-and-quantify methods is the <em>in situ</em> characterization of lignin. <em>In situ</em> chemical imaging methods such as the chromogenic Wiesner test or observation of lignin autofluorescence have been used to detect lignin since the 19th century. However, extracting reliable quantitative read-outs from such methods has only become feasible in recent years, with improving instrumentation and careful biochemical validation of the results. Conceptually, we can describe methods for lignin <em>in situ</em> analysis on three axes: spatial resolution, chemical resolution and quantitative capacity (<a href="#fig-methods" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;3</a>). All methods represent trade-offs along these three axes, with further differences in required effort and instrumentation, which we roughly outline in the following (further details of the mentioned methods and others are tabulated in the table S1). Which of these methods will provide the most valuable insights depends on the scientific question, and should be considered carefully.</p>

<p>Electron microscopy in combination with the KMnO<sub>4</sub> lignin stain, antibodies, or radioactively labelled precursors, provides information about lignin distribution with the highest spatial resolution. Those methods, depending on their sophistication, can also yield very high chemical resolution (<a href="#fig-methods" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;3</a>). Detailed insight in the diversity of lignin polymers between cell wall layers was shown using KMnO<sub>4</sub> staining to reveal a globular topology in PCW layers compared to rod-shaped in SCWs, conserved between plant species.<span class="citation" data-cites="Donaldson2001"><sup><a href="#ref-Donaldson2001" role="doc-biblioref">48</a></sup></span> Total sample size for electron microscopy is limited, precluding full organ biopsies. However, the main weakness of electron microscopy-based methods are the limited quantitative read-outs. Although changes in radioactivity correlate with the incorporation of radioactive precursors, both the possible metabolisation of the fed compounds into chemically distinct monomers as well as artefactual labeling due to mislocalisation of the compound during feeding hinder any reliable semi-quantitative measurements. In contrast, antibody density detected through gold particles correlates more robustly with antigen density and several reports showed similar semi-quantitative trends between cell wall layers, cell types and plant species.<span class="citation" data-cites="Joseleau2004 Ruel2009"><sup><a href="#ref-Joseleau2004" role="doc-biblioref">49</a>,<a href="#ref-Ruel2009" role="doc-biblioref">50</a></sup></span> Nonetheless, both antibody affinity and epitope accessibility can be hard to predict <em>in situ,</em> warranting careful interpretation. Very useful exceptions to this quantitative limitation are X-ray microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). X-ray microscopy can quantify aromatic carbons due to their specific absorption to define lignin distribution.<span class="citation" data-cites="Boyce2004"><sup><a href="#ref-Boyce2004" role="doc-biblioref">22</a></sup></span> Similarly, EDS can be coupled with electron microscopy to quantitatively map elemental abundances in the sample — albeit in practice with a slightly lower spatial resolution than electron microscopy itself. Considering the much higher C/O ratio of lignin compared to cell wall polysaccharides, EDS can estimate relative lignin content with nanometre-precision.<span class="citation" data-cites="Menard2022"><sup><a href="#ref-Menard2022" role="doc-biblioref">19</a></sup></span></p>

<p>Light microscopy methods, using chromogenic and fluorescent stains or exploiting lignin autofluorescence, can provide semi-quantitative read-outs with considerable spatial and chemical resolution. Given adequate sample preparation, the spatial resolution of these methods is close to the diffraction limit. The combination of fluorescent lignin stains such as Rhodamine B with super-resolution microscopy even goes beyond that, resolving differences in lignin quantity below 100 nm.<span class="citation" data-cites="Donaldson2022"><sup><a href="#ref-Donaldson2022" role="doc-biblioref">51</a></sup></span> Of the numerous chromogenic and fluorescent lignin stains only very few have been validated regarding their quantitative capacity and chemical specificity.

Their distribution <em>in situ</em> indicates where different lignin monomers might be actively incorporated into lignin at the time of feeding. The caveat is that the position of the fluorescent label or click ligation site affects metabolization and polymerization of the fed compounds. While these data give no direct information of lignin quantity or composition, the method has been successfully used to for example demonstrate LAC substrate-specificity in compression wood lignification.<span class="citation" data-cites="Hiraide2021"><sup><a href="#ref-Hiraide2021" role="doc-biblioref">7</a></sup></span> Altogether, transmitted light and fluorescence microscopy-based methods provide a useful, low-cost toolbox for lignin characterisation <em>in situ</em>.

<h3 data-number="5.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="microspectroscopy"><span class="header-section-number">5.3</span> Microspectroscopy</h3>
<p>Microspectroscopy read-outs have the highest information density. These methods are generally label-free, exploiting inherent physicochemical characteristics of the lignin polymers. Beside spectroscopic methods based on fluorescence (discussed above), Raman and Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) microspectroscopy are perhaps most commonly used for lignin <em>in situ</em> analysis. Both methods exploit the vibrational states of covalent bonds — Raman instruments detect photons scattered by these shifting vibrational states, whereas FT-IR measures their absorbance. Each bond creates a specific signal, which is further modulated by the directly adjacent bonds. For lignin, that means that the signal is influenced by the incorporated monomers, their position in the polymer and the inter-molecular linkages.<span class="citation" data-cites="Yamamoto2020a"><sup><a href="#ref-Yamamoto2020a" role="doc-biblioref">60</a></sup></span> Although they exploit the same physical phenomenon, Raman and FT-IR have distinct advantages for cell wall analysis. FT-IR is more sensitive to polar groups (O—H, C=O) and tends to provide less noisy spectra for cell walls.<span class="citation" data-cites="Guillon2022"><sup><a href="#ref-Guillon2022" role="doc-biblioref">61</a></sup></span> In return, the method is inherently limited to resolutions in the µm range, requires very thin sections and struggles with hydrated samples due to water absorbance.<span class="citation" data-cites="Guillon2022"><sup><a href="#ref-Guillon2022" role="doc-biblioref">61</a></sup></span> Raman on the other hand is more sensitive to carbon bonds (C—C, C=C), allows spatial resolutions around 300 nm and is insensitive to water in the sample.<span class="citation" data-cites="Guillon2022"><sup><a href="#ref-Guillon2022" role="doc-biblioref">61</a></sup></span> It does not require thin sections and can be used non-destructively on <em>e.g.</em> fossils.<span class="citation" data-cites="Qu2019"><sup><a href="#ref-Qu2019" role="doc-biblioref">62</a></sup></span> The downside of Raman microspectroscopy is the enormous amount of spectral information contained in each cell wall spectrum. Even more so than in FT-IR, the numerous bonds in the sample result in a highly convoluted spectrum, making the quantification of isolated bands difficult. One approach to overcome this convolution is the unmixing of hypothetical “pure” molecules of different polymers in the sample, so-called endmembers. Such unmixing has facilitated <em>e.g.</em> the discovery that hydrolyzable tannins are incorporated into the lignified cell walls of <em>Trapa natans</em> seeds.<span class="citation" data-cites="Huss2024"><sup><a href="#ref-Huss2024" role="doc-biblioref">63</a></sup></span> While useful, the large effects of chosen algorithm and endmember number warrant careful interpretation and validation of the unmixed spectra. Alternatively, avoiding any potential artifacts of unmixing, spectra can be evaluated without deconvolution. Although the precision of measurements acquired with this approach is diminished by overlapping bands, it has been successfully used to reveal lignin composition differences resulting from distinct LAC substrate-specificities.<span class="citation" data-cites="Blaschek2020 Blaschek2023"><sup><a href="#ref-Blaschek2023" role="doc-biblioref">20</a>,<a href="#ref-Blaschek2020" role="doc-biblioref">64</a></sup></span> <em>In vitro,</em> isolated from the convoluted signal of plant cell walls, model compounds of lignin monomers, oligomers (such as dibenzodioxocin) and polymers can be distinguished in even more detail.<span class="citation" data-cites="Bock2020 Blaschek2020"><sup><a href="#ref-Blaschek2020" role="doc-biblioref">64</a>,<a href="#ref-Bock2020" role="doc-biblioref">65</a></sup></span></p>
<p>Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) functions via the ionization of molecules at the sample surface and their subsequent mass-spectrometric identification. With an axial resolution of 1–2 nm, lateral resolutions down to 50 nm and the capacity to in principle distinguish any ionizable molecule, TOF-SIMS – in theory – trumps most other methods for <em>in situ</em> lignin analysis. In practice however, used pixel sizes of range between 300 and 500 nm and the number of empirically assigned peaks is limited, resulting lower resolutions and signal-to-noise ratios than can be achieved with, for example, Raman imaging. Additionally, the necessary sample drying can distort cell wall layer organization. Nonetheless, TOF-SIMS offers unique opportunities — quantitative <em>in situ</em> distinction of <em>p</em>-hydroxybenzoate- and S-units, for example, is not currently possible with any other method.<span class="citation" data-cites="Mottiar2023"><sup><a href="#ref-Mottiar2023" role="doc-biblioref">66</a></sup></span></p>
<p>X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy are included here, in a collection of <em>in situ</em> imaging techniques, prospectively. XPS is routinely used in cell wall analysis, providing absolute quantities of atoms and bonds on the sample surface.<span class="citation" data-cites="Watts2022"><sup><a href="#ref-Watts2022" role="doc-biblioref">67</a></sup></span> Similarly, solid-state NMR is an established technique that has provided some of the most exciting insights into lignin–carbohydrate interactions in plant cell walls.<span class="citation" data-cites="Kirui2022"><sup><a href="#ref-Kirui2022" role="doc-biblioref">33</a></sup></span> In current practice, however, both of these methods lack imaging features. XPS classically returns data from the irradiated spot with a resolution around 10 µm, while NMR averages over the entire, usually mm-sized sample. While not yet in common use for biological samples, both single cell NMR and XPS imaging are feasible and have seen rapid developments in recent years. If those developments continue, XPS and NMR imaging might soon provide detailed sub-micron information about elemental bonds and whole lignin structures respectively.</p>

<p>In the last three years, the methods outlined herein have been used to dramatically alter our understanding of lignification. Until very recently, the prevalent model considered that lignification was exclusively controlled by monomer availability. Now we know that both LAC/PRX substrate-specificity<span class="citation" data-cites="Blaschek2023 Hiraide2021 Zhuo2022"><sup><a href="#ref-Hiraide2021" role="doc-biblioref">7</a>,<a href="#ref-Zhuo2022" role="doc-biblioref">17</a>,<a href="#ref-Blaschek2023" role="doc-biblioref">20</a></sup></span> and the molecular chaperoning by dirigent proteins<span class="citation" data-cites="Gao2023"><sup><a href="#ref-Gao2023" role="doc-biblioref">32</a></sup></span> have decisive, cell type-specific effects on lignin amount and composition. These mechanisms, along with monomer supply and LAC/PRX co-substrate availability, direct a tightly regulated program of lignification, leading to distinct sub-cellular localisations and compositions depending on cell type, developmental status and environmental cues. For most lignified cell types, however, we still have almost no data capturing their lignin biochemistry with subcellular resolution. That kind of data, combined with <em>in situ</em> methods to probe cell wall biomechanics and topology, will be crucial to understand which structural aspects of lignified cell walls allow them to fulfill their varying functions. It might seem like a purely fundamental research question, but knowing how and where to modify lignins without impeding plant growth or survival will be key to generate new, more efficient feedstock for industrial exploitation. Hence, a detailed understanding of lignin’s cell type-specific structure-function relationships has the potential to significantly advance our path to a sustainable economy.</p>
