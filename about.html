	  My research aims to explain how plants modulate wood properties from one cell type to another 
	  and on even smaller scales. As plant cells fulfill very different purposes, the composition and 
	  therfore the structural characteristics of their cell walls tend to vary widely between cell types. 
	  Lignin &ndash; from the latin <i>lignum*</i> for wood &ndash; is a complex, polyphenolic polymer 
	  that reinforces, waterproofs and protects the plant cell wall. How plants achieve the especially 
	  sharp gradients in lignin amount and composition on a sub-cellular scale is however still largely 
	  unknown. <br><br>
	I use genetic transformation of model plants coupled with biochemical and cytological analyses to investigate 
	  whether <i>LACCASES</i>, the proteins that are responsible for the polymerisation of lignin, have 
	  more specific roles than is widely assumed. Showing cell-type specific activity of different lacccases 
	  towards selected lignin building-blocks would significantly advance our understanding of how plants 
	  form the second most abundant biopolymer on earth. Moreover, it would enable cell specific manipulation 
	  of cell wall properties to design biomass that can be easily processed, reducing the need for chemical 
	  bleaching. <br><br>
	Plants fascinate, force perspectives unfamiliar to us mammals and are uniquely fundamental to life. When I 
	  am not investigating how plants work, I try to spend as much time as possible among them.
