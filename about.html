	  Plant physiology and morphology are dependent on a multitude of different specialised cell types. 
	  All of them are surrounded by a cell wall, which functions both as an exoskeleton for each individual cell and a cohesive interface between them, giving rise to tissues and organs.
	  Fundamentally, the cell wall is a gel-like matrix composed of multiple bio-polymers including pectins, cellulose and hemicelluloses. 
	  In woody cells, this hydrophilic matrix is waterproofed and further reinforced by a polyphenolic called <i>lignin</i>.
	  Along with the distinct functions of different cell types in the plant, the composition and biochemical characteristics of their cell walls vary widely. 
	  However, both the mechanism of how cell wall properties are modulated on the nanometre scale, and how these differences support the function of the respective cell, are still poorly understood. 
	  <br><br>
      I use genetic manipulation of model plants coupled with biochemical, bio-mechanical and cytological analyses to investigate the regulation and effect of specific changes in lignin content in the cell wall. 
	  I am especially interested in whether <i>Laccases</i> &mdash; proteins involved in the oxidative polymerisation of lignin &mdash; have more specific roles than is widely assumed and potentially direct lignin composition on the sub-cellular scale.
	  Understanding the process of lignification on this scale would allow us to engineer plants that are more efficient renewable energy sources or sustainable building materials, whithout compromising plant growth.<br><br>
      When I am not working to understand their inner workings, I spend as much of my time as possible hiking, climbing and canoeing among plants.
